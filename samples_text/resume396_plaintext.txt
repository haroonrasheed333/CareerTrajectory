PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY:
Fraud Protection (Product Development):

Environment: Windows 2008, IIS 7.0, .NET Framework 3.0, C#, XML, XSD, WCF, WSCF ,
XSLT, XPATH, SQL Server 2005, Enterprise Library 4.0.

Fraud Protection is an identity protection based product which required compiling data from
multiple Credit/Identity sources and fulfill as individual fulfillment reports. The system required
integrating different functional and system level components related with Enrollments, Fulfillment,
Business Workflow engines, Data Aggregation, Billing and Reporting Systems.

   &#183;   Worked closely with the Project Director and business owners to create a project task plan,
       reviews the plan with the project team and executes the plan to completion.
   &#183;   Reviewed and analyzed business requirements.
   &#183;   Documented service models, database schema, object definitions and UML class interfaces.
   &#183;   Architected, designed and developed multi-tiered distributed web services to interface with
       GUI based client applications in .NET Framework.
   &#183;   Developed core data access and business layers to interface with various sub-systems in a
       SOA Architecture.



                                                                                                      4
        &#183;   Secured using KB Authentication model for inter application communication.
        &#183;   Modeled Test Driven development environment for Unit testing.


    Bureau Alerting Engine:

    Environment: Windows 2003, IIS 6.0, .NET Framework 3.0, C#, XML, WSE 3.0, XSD, WCF,
    Microsoft Message Queuing, WSCF, SQL Server 2005, Enterprise Library 3.0.

    Functional scope of this project was to build an automated process to place fraud alerts at the 3
    major credit bureaus. These alerts would be refreshed each 90 days for the customers. Technical
    scope of this project involved in designing system interfaces to integrate new/existing sub systems in
    a loosely coupled architecture with high scalability and performance.

        &#183;   Worked closely with data vendors, IVR system providers and internal business analysis team
            to conduct a feasibility analysis and help document functional and risk assessment report.
        &#183;   Define new/updated schema definitions to interface with Data Aggregation engine, product
            configuration, Marketing, CRM and workflow sub-systems.
        &#183;   Documented service models, database schema, object definitions and UML class interfaces.
        &#183;   Implemented WSE 3.0 based X509 Cert based Authentication system to allow external
            vendors to consume web services hosted on Application platform.
