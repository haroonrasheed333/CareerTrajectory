VOIP Technician
OBJECTIVE:
To obtain a fast paced, multi-tasking position that will utilize my current
Skills and talents while allowing me to learn new skills and have an 
Opportunity for career and personal growth. I am a motivated self-starter
That does not require someone telling me every step to take. I have put together
Computers and networked them. I have learned over the years that a challenge
 Can be fun. I like to be a team player. At Terra Telecom I was a Team Leader
 (Job that was just like a Service Manager)I was over 4 Technicians. I Mentor
 And dispatch the members of the team for Programming, Troubleshooting, repairs, and installation, moves and changes. I was in charge Of their Education on the Toshiba product line. Gave tech support, did site Surveys &amp; help with solutions (Job like a Sales Engineer) for sales personnel. Worked with IT staff for voice over IP solutions. Trained project managers on The Toshiba product. Obtained secret security clearance at Kwajalein. I know how to make deadlines.  One quick trick I can show you is just calling me at 918-212-6271 it will be a VOIP call from Oklahoma to the Island of Kwajalein.
