Philosophy around Public Relations and Marketing within Sales-driven Organizations:

Marketing and public relations should be the foundation of a sales driven organization. The planning and implementation around future market penetration, regional campaigns and product development is fueled by marketing/public relations and can produce ground cover for a sales team prior to their arrival.
