Dear Sir or Madam,

My last job was working for GE's Power &amp; Energy Division in Engineering, through Adecco Technical, where I worked as a composition operator, working directly with engineers preparing proposals and contracts for wind, thermal and gas projects worldwide. Before GE, I worked as a product support specialist for a software company that makes software for Adobe. I set up and demo this product for clients all over the world. I am looking for work full time or on a contract level. 

I have been designing and directing for 20 years in every phase of advertising for non-profits, artists, arts and woman's groups, museums, historic groups, along with a long list of very prestigious companies and organizations, including recently JP Morgan Chase and the Woodstock Historical Society and Film Festival. 

I am currently attending SUNY ESC to complete my BS, majoring in Information Technology.

I have enclosed a resume and samples for your perusal. If you should have any questions or concerns, or should need more samples, please call or email.
