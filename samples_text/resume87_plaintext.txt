       Investigated and compared compound solubility study for suitable solvents and extraction solvents
       Designed and performed compound recovery study and matrix effects on plasma and tissues, compound stability in
       plasma and tissues on bench with different temperatures and pH conditions
       Designed and evaluated sample extraction procedures based on the nature of compounds and tissues involved using
       protein precipitations, liquid-liquid extractions and SPE
       Evaluated compound stocks for standards and QCs for acceptance and selected suitable solvents for spike stocks for
       plasma and tissues.
       Strong believer in performing on building multiple Q1/Q3 transition quantitation methods with LC separations of
       compounds to improve sensitivities and deal with matrix interference issues.
       Collaboratively analyzed ALL failed experiments with proposal of appropriated solutions
       Detail and results driven performer on non GLP PK &amp; TK sample batches using LC-MS/MS methods on mouse,
       rat, monkey and human plasma and tissues with final presentation and reports
       Worked closely with the supervisor in drafting lab PK run acceptance criteria in qualification and sample batches.
       Hands on experience in in vivo DMPK studies focusing on plasma bioanalysis and PK parameters
       Performed WinNonlin (ver 5.0.1) to generate PK report in Cmax, Tmax, AUC, t 1/2, CL and BA %
       Major investigator in metabolic identification, mass fragment assembly and compound purity checks using
       LC/MS/MS on radioactive labeled (C14) and/or isotope (C13) compounds.
       Generated study data reports, method summary reports and bioanalytical reports for regulatory filings
       Transferred non GLP methods to CRO for GLP studies, working closely with CRO, monitoring progress, sample
       tracking, troubleshooting and communicating
       Reviewed CRO data, validation reports, and CRO in house SOP making recommendations to CROs and sponsors in
       discussions and review reports
       Worked closely with a principal scientist in metabolite programs as a MS participant to identify major IDX184
       metabolite (S5) being identified synthesized and quantified.
       Conducted maintaining, trouble shooting and regular maintenance of API 3000, 3200 and 4000 QTrap with Agilent
       and Schimadzu LC systems, minimizing operation downtime and cost.
      Major contributor for in vitro metabolism of non nucleoside PI compound effects in liver sub cellular fractions
      (CYP family, especially the CYP3A4) using LC-MS/MS methods for quantitation.
      Performed LC-MS/MS and evaluated metabolic stability studies in liver microsomes and hepatocytes in phase I and
      phase II to provide the data for prediction of compound in vitro metabolism models
