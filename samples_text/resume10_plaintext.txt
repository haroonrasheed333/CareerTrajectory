Experience

Independent Projects										Forterra Systems Inc, Software Engineer							September 2007 - May 2009
Development Environment: C++ and XML for Windows and Linux using Agile development processes

Extended proprietary platform and developed new user facing features using asynchronous distributed programming technologies for a multi-user virtual world engine powering There.com (a second life competitor) as well as customer-specific situation simulators in an agile programming environment
Contributed to effort to establish and roll out Agile/SCRUM-like process ahead of company-wide integration
Conceived a scalable login information system driving in-world buddy list and social-networking (status, privacy) features
Developed in-world training systems enabling users in the virtual world to launch and attend training modules hosted on customer LMS implementations
Introduced support for creating and replaying interactive virtual combat scenarios with customizable environments and user-specified participant roles, position, inventory, and health models
Implemented an end to end simulation of a Sarin gas attack with a sophisticated medical model calculating realistic health conditions and providing treatment options, allowing an in-world user to triage a victim's exposure and administer treatment
Designed virtual conferencing capabilities with support for real-time sharing of PowerPoint presentations, videos, and whiteboard between in-world users
Replaced legacy mechanism for distributed communication with a lightweight P2P service and trained engineers on its use


Lockheed Martin, Software Engineer							September 2004 - August 2007
Development Environment: C, C++, Java JNI, c-shell scripting for Solaris, Linux, PowerMAX, LynxOS, RedHawk, and VxWorks

Designed and implemented functionality for real-time, mission critical infrastructure software supporting various defensive systems aboard Navy ships
Mentored new developers, identified system requirements and specifications, created technical designs, and supported QA
Produced, tested, and installed build for Enterprise Configuration Management, serving as primary point of technical info for ECM
Designed, implemented, and tested new information relay services to broadcast event log data from multi-threaded local environments to network destinations via multi-cast ports and listen for and consume those events at remote locations
Developed resource management tools such as virtual resource allocation and cleanup services, heartbeat monitoring, process management services, and data analysis of received network messages for profiling systems
Optimized network communication service using a combination of aggregators, buffer allocation managers, and compression algorithms for ultra-high speed data extraction and recording
Developed thread-safe library for data extraction integration project
Spearheaded porting effort for migration of middleware from Solaris to new operating systems and hardware configurations: C for Linux, LynxOS, VxWorks, and OpenVMS platforms
Developed Java JNI APIs to extend existing interfaces for daemon management in an object oriented environment to Linux
