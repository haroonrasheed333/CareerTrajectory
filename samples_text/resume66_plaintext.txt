To Whom It May Concern,
I am actively seeking an employment opportunity anywhere south of New York! Almost 10 years ago I was given an opportunity when Kaiser was bought out to move with the company to Syracuse, New York as a Tool and Process Designer. Prior to that my career had been primarily on the shop floor learning everything from welding, cnc machining, tooling and just about everything in between. I have been programming part for the past year and I am really enjoying the challenge of learning new things. I have strong experience with troubleshooting and I enjoy figuring out the problem solving tasks.
I enjoy my job at TactAir, but my heart and the heart of my family is in the south. I would love the chance to learn something new and use my strengths in a way that my employer is satisfied and I know that I have done the best of my capability.
I trust you will contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration,

Tim Bingham

Objective
Being in manufacturing for over 23 years and in aerospace for over 13, I have had the pleasure to see and implement new and transformational ideas in tooling and manufacturing processes. From drafting tables to 3D printers the excitement of what tomorrow brings keeps me seeking for the next new technology and longing to be part of it. I feel there is a need for persons with the working knowledge of an engineer and the machining experience to put such knowledge into fruition on the shop floor. Solving issues on the shop floor is my passion. I have really enjoyed the opportunity given to me in New York but would love to end my career as a programmer back home in the south.
