Programmer Analyst
Programming with Microsoft Visual Basic .Net as needed for vendor rewrite of Pipeline.

Designed and implemented shipping system needs in conjunction with vendor supplied inventory management warehousing system.
vendor supplied system is Oracle 7.x/8.x based; used ADO data controls and Oracle PL/SQL to access information pertinent to shipping information to aid various business groups. 
Information includes a four-in-one bill of lading, shipping manifests, export check sheets, as well as a menu driven interface to allow new reports or interfaces to be designed and tested with Visual Basic 6.0.
Technical environment includes Unix (HP) on a HP 9000, shell scripting, Oracle 7.3/8.0, PL/SQL, isual Basic 5.0/6.0 using ADO and DAO with Oracle.
Manage vendor supplied system problems with internal champions to correct issues as they arise.
HP 9000 Unix ANSI C/C++ programming, including Oracle Pro*C. Worked on a mission critical interface from vendor supplied shipping software and vendor supplied forecasting software.
Developed database on Oracle 7.3.x that allows program tracking and system issue resolutions to be maintained.
Developed a menu program in Visual C++ 6.0 using MFC that is similar to the Visual Basic 5.0/6.0 menu program. Provides flexibility in which solution is best suited to any particular need.
Developed Order tracking system that tracks changes to orders (whether it was a customer request or a Murray, Inc. personnel request for a change). Utilized Pro*C, PL/SQL (for database implementation) and Visual Basic 6.0 to present various reports.














Analysts International Corp. 3.97 - 9.98

Systems Analyst 
Designed and implemented automatic call distribution database entities with a team of developers and users to eliminate a need for operator assistance on the majority of telephone queries received.
Designed interfaces between Aspect telephone switch and the Call Center using various methods to develop a core group of support options the call flow would provide. The call-flow was developed with Aspect Agility via interactive voice response (IVR) with the caller.
Interfaced Scopus v3.6.2 with the Aspect switch to allow technicians to transfer calls, log support issues, etc. on a real time basis. For example, a telephone call comes to a technician, he/she determines that the support is predicated by pay-per-issue billing, the technician transfers call to support billing who will handle the call until the technician is requested again.
Developed mechanism to determine rate of errors the Aspect switch was reporting (call dropped, call lost, call destination unknown, etc.) by interpreting the errors reported in various log files with C++ and saving the results in a Sybase SQL database for reporting mechanisms (Crystal Reports primarily).
Unix (AIX) on an RS/6000 using IBM Xlc C/C++ to develop reporting tools for client/server based technical support center at client site.

Utilized Sybase SQL Server 11.0 including Transact-SQL and BCP utilities

Developed a siren application based on object oriented methodology that could use a radio telephone connection to determine if a siren was to sound based upon DTMF input.
Implemented generic call flow interface that was based partly on existing code and upon object oriented methodology previously developed.
Developed Windows 95 products based upon CDOS products using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0, Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0, and Sybase SQL Anywhere.

Equinox Information Systems 10.94 - 11.95
Programmer
Worked extensively with client server architecture for telephone billing systems and telephone fraud detection utilizing a Novell network.
Programs generally followed an existing design, but could change due to DEC switch changes

Used Turbo Pascal, Watcom C/C++, and Paradox 4.5 to implement the majority of tasks.
Technical environment included Borland Turbo C/C++, Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0, Watcom C/C++ 10, and Paradox 4.5 for DOS, RS-232.
