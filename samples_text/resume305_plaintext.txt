To Whom it May Concern :

Having worked with various iterations of V-Code for the past nine years, I would like to be considered for any online, work from home, document coding, QCing, Unitizing projects using the IPro V-Code software that you might have.

I have recently retired from the coding management team at ACV Litigation, LLC.  I loved my job, but they moved away from using IPro V-Code as their platform for data gathering and the work has slowed down to the point where I need to find different employment. 

As Coding Team Manager with ACV Litigation, LLC, my duties ranged from hiring and training people in the software to tracking their work and entering data for their pay onto a spreadsheet for submission.  I also was responsible for some frontend (creating unitizing and coding batches) and backending the projects once the coding/qc work was completed.  I was not involved in any delivery process to the clients.  

Thank you for any information you can give me regarding any future I may have with your organization.
