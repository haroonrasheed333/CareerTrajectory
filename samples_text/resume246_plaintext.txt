Experience

Senior Maintenance Developer
Duties for this position included diagnosis and correction of pre-existing defects in the software and re-writing the programs as deemed necessary. Changes to documentation were also part of the responsibility.
 
Drug Accountability V3.0
Personnaly corrected xx number of defects out of xxx.
This package provides functionality to maintain a perpetual inventory of drugs. Interfacing with the Generic Inventory Package (GIP) and the prime vendors. Invoice data increments drug balances in pharmacy locations and master vaults. Pharmacy's dispensing software packages pass dispensing data to Drug Acountability which decrements the drug balances in pharmacy locations.

Controlled Substances V3.0
The Controlled Substances (CS) software package is one segment of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) installed at VA medical centers. The Controlled Substances module provides functionality to monitor and track the receipt, inventory, and dispensing of all controlled substances. This module provides the pharmacy with the capability to define a controlled substance location and a list of controlled substances to maintain a perpetual inventory.

This software provides the capability for pharmacy personnel to receive a Controlled Substances order, automatically update the quantity on hand, and view a receipt history. Nursing personnel are provided with the ability to request orders for Controlled Substances via on-demand requests. Pharmacy may dispense controlled substances via the software automating all necessary documents (VA FORMS 10-2321 and 10-2638) to complete an order request. The software provides functionality to record AMIS and Cost data, address returns to stock, destructions, order cancellations, transfers between locations, and log outpatient prescriptions.

Pharmacy Prescription Practice V1.0
I received quarterly updates via diskette that contained all information related to Veterans' visits to each VA Medical Center. Through my software, a physician could determine when/if the patient had been to other facilities. This reduced the chances over over medication or substance abuse. This package was retired in March of 2009.
