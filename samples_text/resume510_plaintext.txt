Dear Sir or Madam:

Creativity is my passion. Whether producing advertising campaigns for Universal Studios' famous destinations; print collateral for an upcoming Scholastic Book Fair's season; or graphic design for the Fortune 500 global security giant, Lockheed Martin.  my focus, and ingenuity, are invested in each image, font and technique.
 
As a skilled senior graphic designer, independent agencies and global fast-paced environments have provided a solid foundation for my next professional endeavor. Whether working independently or with a team, I invest my strong motivation in each project from concept to completion. My ability to manage a diverse and heavy project load is reinforced by time-management and attention to detail. 

With over 12 years of experience and a perfectionist by nature, I love what I do and excel at it! I generate solutions through creative design, and meet project milestones on time and within budget.

Thank you for reviewing my accompanying r&#233;sum&#233;. I welcome the opportunity to share my portfolio with you and discuss my potential for making a significant contribution to your company.


Best regards,
Joey Gomez
