                                       INTRODUCTION
We celebrate them, honor them, and anxiously wait for their arrival: holidays, and all the history
that surrounds them. But do you ever wonder what our favorite holiday icons do the other 364
days of the year? February 30: The Secret Alter-Egos of Reluctant Holiday Heroes captures just
that. Join Phil, Nick, Pete, Paddy, Edna and the rest of the crew as they completely turn your image
of the cherished holidays upside-down!


                                               CAST
February 30 is a strip with a versatile cast. Topics can range from political and social satire to intra-
cast stories, from holiday traditions to slapstick. Often times the characters' personalities are
diametrically opposed to what we might image them to be. Additionally, Jimmy Buffet claims
that "it's 5:00 somewhere;" likewise, it is always a holiday somewhere, so the structure is flexible
enough to allow for cameo appearances from various obscure holidays from around the world.

              Pocket LintTM

              Pocket LintTM is a collection of one-panel gags in the vein of the Far Side and others. When I
              come home from work and empty my pockets, I find things that remind me of the day's events:
              paper clips from business reports, dry cleaning receipts, loose change, and of course the
              ever-present lint. Similarly, when I empty my mind of the day's thoughts, I find these cartoon
              ideas. Hence the name.

            Fitzpatrick the RatTM

            Fitzpatrick the RatTM was created in 1992. He was originally created to populate a comic strip
            about life in a college dorm. Later, the setting for the strip was changed to a house, and
            Fitzpatrick was the thorn in the side of the home owners. The strip was submitted for
            syndication, and gained some level of interest on the part of syndicates. However, nothing ever
            materialized in the form of a syndication agreement.

            To pass the time and keep my drawing hand fresh, I made Fitzpatrick and advocate of the Apple
            Macintosh computer. In that form, he amassed a small but faithful following, and was published
            regularly in Mac Addict and Mac World (China).

            When Chuck's wife Michelle developed All About You &amp; Me!, she insisted that Fitzpatrick be
            brought out of retirement and into this children's book.

         HarvelTM

         I don't know why I started this strip. I had some farm characters that I wanted to play with. I
         thought the concept of a strip where animals discussed current events was interesting (although
         not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination). I also had Harvel, this country-bumpkin
         farmer. I liked the way Harvel looked, with his floppy straw hat and droopy piece of hay in his
         mouth.

         I didn't get a very positive reaction from the world of syndication on this strip, but if you get a
         chuckle out of it, it was worth the time.
