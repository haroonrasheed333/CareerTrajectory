about me
Howdy! I'm Jessie Daryl Cacafranca, 25 years of age, 5 years experience in web design and development and I'm a Web
Designer here in Cebu, Philippines.

In 2006, I earned my diploma Major in Multimedia and the Internet at Informatics SM City Cebu which I had an award of being the
Best in Multimedia student. Since then, I start doing some freelance work with some local clients in Cebu. After college, then I
started working in an outsourcing web development company which my skills gain and improve especially when it comes to
concepts, color theory, typography, arts, coding standards, and flexibility of the design.

In my first job, I did a lot of corporate designs and learn XHTML/CSS. After having experiencing in my previous company, later on
I moved to an entertainment company which is Bigfoot Entertainment with 2yrs+ experienced in related field. The next step of my
career was moving to a Danish company which is Cebu-Denmark Animation Studio Incorporated as a Web/Graphic designer and
later on promoted to Acting Project Manager. Furthermore, my career bloomed and relocated to the middle east working as a Web
Designer/Photographer of a major holding company in Saudi Arabia.

I'm learning new things when it comes to web. I can be a flexible artist, and can translate structured html to HTML5/CSS3 and
Creative designs.
