I provide or maintain several functions as a consultant and volunteer.  First, I am updated on current software applications.  Second, I receive satisfaction in assisting students better understand accounting principles.  Third, I conduct financial research for different projects and develop preliminary budgetary information for federal and state grant applications for business school programs.  Fourth, from developing budgets and performing analysis work, I maintain my technical accounting skills sharp with hands-on experience.      

PLEASE NOTE:  My absence from the workforce has been the result of a sluggish economy and changes in employer's preferences for experience coupled with advanced degrees.  Due to these preference changes, I made the career decision to return to school to further my education but a slow economic recovery continues to hold true for a longer than anticipated period of unemployment following graduation.  I assure you that you should have no concern of any lack of recent work experience or lack of technical skills.  It is vital that you understand my absence has not affected my ability or judgment to execute the responsibilities and duties of this position.  My primary objective is to focus on the needs of your company's financial resources for future growth, increase profitability while minimizing costs and maintaining internal control compliance.  I am confident I will serve as a valuable asset for this purpose.  I bring to the table the expertise, the experience, the eagerness and the wisdom to produce these results.

Salary requirements are negotiable dependent upon the total benefit and compensation package.  I am willing to relocate for this position.  

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Darrell Keel
