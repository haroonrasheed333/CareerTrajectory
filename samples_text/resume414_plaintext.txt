Summary  
At Del Rey Studios, my duties include creating 2D and 3D art for game companies.  These range from Storyboards, Graphic Design, motion graphics, as well as some animation.  I've also contributed in concept design and Low-Poly modeling of in-game units and structures, as well as environment art.
On the side, I create a daily comic strip called Frank and Steinway.  It appears on Gocomics.com, in their Sherpa section.  This same strip is also published in a weekly paper in Northern California.
Previously, I was an Artist/ Game  designer at Electronic Arts, Dragonstone Software and Disney Interactive.

I have also been a nationally syndicated cartoonist.
