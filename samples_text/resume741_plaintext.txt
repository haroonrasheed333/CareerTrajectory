PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Appen News/Forsyth Herald 					       03/03 - 02/04
Freelance Writer 
I reported daily on the special events and student/staff achievements at the Forsyth County School system's 24 schools. 
I combined personable interviewing and honest reporting skills with dedicated photography shots to achieve an open and productive relationship with teachers, students, parents and school administrative officials. I became a familiar face at several school system functions often snaring a report of a low key event that placed school administration in a positive photo and news story opportunity.

During this full-time employment break I was raising my sons and working as a sales associate at Macy's Department store.

Forsyth County News					                  10/00 - 08/01
Staff Writer 
As a staff writer for The FCN, which had a subscriber base of 15,000, I reported on special events and student/staff achievements in the public school system and two private schools in Forsyth County, GA. This coverage included Board of Education and legislative assignments that focused on the hot topics of state and local education issues. It was my daily responsibility to proofread news pages before submission of final copy. 
I successfully met daily copy deadlines by consistently producing two or more articles with photography credits. My photo credits regularly made front page above fold position. 
I also wrote feature articles spotlighted in special sections including "Women of Forsyth County," "Men of Forsyth County" and "Progress and Senior Life."
