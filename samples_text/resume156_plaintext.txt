Overview
In a variety of professional roles, I have garnered substantial experience working under minimal supervision within small, interdisciplinary teams, on multiple, fast-paced projects. My work in production design has enabled me to hone skills in workflow management, web content management, client interface, and continuous design and process improvement. I possess a strong work ethic and have excellent computer, organizational, and people skills.
