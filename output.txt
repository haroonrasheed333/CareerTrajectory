PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Allied Pharmacy Consultants-Alpharetta, GA			      06/05 - Present
Pharmacy Technician/Billing Specialist
I secured a pharmacy technician position with an independent retail pharmacy specializing in pain management care for workers compensation claimants. It was my goal to familiarize myself with every aspect of this specialty pharmacy. My responsibilities are concentrated on insurance billing &amp; collections, monitoring &amp; re-ordering the drug inventory, communicating daily with patients and doctors offices to verify refill authorizations. 
I developed a system to gather documentation on provider enrollment for Medicare &amp; Georgia Medicaid billing which resulted in more efficient collection of patient reimbursements. 
I helped improve client satisfaction through quality control processes which included patient follow-up and order/delivery verification. 

I have been dedicated to raising my two sons. In addition, I was employed full-time for eight months as a billing specialist at North Fulton Pain Center located at North Fulton Hospital and as a sales associate/cash office coordinator at Stein Mart department store for 2 years.

Appen News/Forsyth Herald 					       03/03 - 02/04
Freelance Writer 
I reported daily on the special events and student/staff achievements at the Forsyth County School system's 24 schools. 
I combined personable interviewing and honest reporting skills with dedicated photography shots to achieve an open and productive relationship with teachers, students, parents and school administrative officials. I became a familiar face at several school system functions often snaring a report of a low key event that placed school administration in a positive photo and news story opportunity.

During this full-time employment break I was raising my sons and working as a sales associate at Macy's Department store.

Forsyth County News					                  10/00 - 08/01
Staff Writer 
As a staff writer for The FCN, which had a subscriber base of 15,000, I reported on special events and student/staff achievements in the public school system and two private schools in Forsyth County, GA. This coverage included Board of Education and legislative assignments that focused on the hot topics of state and local education issues. It was my daily responsibility to proofread news pages before submission of final copy. 
I successfully met daily copy deadlines by consistently producing two or more articles with photography credits. My photo credits regularly made front page above fold position. 
I also wrote feature articles spotlighted in special sections including "Women of Forsyth County," "Men of Forsyth County" and "Progress and Senior Life."

Improvising Xen Hypervisor (Cloud Computing)                                              May 2012
     Even though Xen handles user instance data efficiently, if third party breaks into the system then user
       data is easily accessible to hacker. If the user data is encrypted and stored then even if the hacker hacks
       the system user data will be safe.
     We are adding an encryption/decryption module in blktap2 part of Xen Hypervisor where user data will
       be stored in encrypted form and it will be decrypted when user asks for it.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Marc graduated from college in 1980 and his first job out of school was with International Harvester; he was involved with creation of COBOL programs.  After that he worked at PMSC doing updates and new development to online and batch COBOL programs and continued on in Mainframe development for the next 2 decades. Marc also has knowledge specific to the insurance industry having tested on INS21 General Principles, INS22 Property and INS23 Casualty Insurance. At this point in his career, COBOL development has become routine for Marc. More recently, Marc has made an effort to update his skill set attempting to become more relevant in today's competitive IT market. He's received training on PL/SQL development and has recently been exposed to C#.NET. Marc is available to interview immediately but he requires 1-2 weeks before he can start an assignment. His additional career highlights are bulleted below. 

The Data Analyst is responsible for creating reports and interpreting trends from a variety of data sources to assist the Vehicle Technical Service group in making business decisions to improve vehicle quality. This position requires strong knowledge of automotive or manufacturing statistical methods for quality analysis and reporting. The position is responsible for taking data from various systems and sources and creating methods to interpret and summarize conclusions that are actionable and relevant. The position supports the Vehicle Technical Service quality improvement process and is responsible for assisting with  ad-hoc reporting requests from many business units.
Prior to 2001 I worked 10 years as a Mainframe Developer in COBOL, PL, IDMS, DB2, IMS, SAS and CICS.
Used Identity Management and Oracle Security Token Service as an enterprise-level solution that facilitates Token exchange, Identity propagation and end-to-end Security across web services through a Token based identity
I'm familiar with UNIX and its commands/utilities at the user level. Can edit files using more than one editor. Uses at least two shells one of them being UNIX.
Used PowerBuilder and data-handling object called a DataWindow, which is used to create, edit, and display data from the database.
Use of packages helps with organized code management and act like containers for related subprograms, and items. 
Published Applications across a WAN. Ability to understand and apply the inter-relationships of servers and applications in the work environment.
Used (APEX) as an entirely web-based development framework that is built into every edition of Oracle Database.
Used Apex to addresses globalization, scalability, security, and other concerns of enterprise-level development. 
Oracle APEX allows a fast development cycle to be achieved to create web based applications. 
Oracle ADF is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Separating applications into these layers simplifies maintenance and reuse of components across applications. The independence of each layer from the other results in a loosely coupled Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Oracle ADF implements MVC and further separates the model layer from the business services to enable service-oriented development of applications
Oracle ADF is the tool that enables a single design-time environment for Oracle SOA Suite 11g is JDeveloper. JDeveloper is a mature, award-winning design and development tool that has been proven and hardened over the years. JDeveloper is not only used to create SCA assembly models, but also to create SCA deployment modules, BPEL processes, Mediator configurations, dashboards, traditional Java applications, web and portal applications and more.
Oracle provides a complete SOA software solution - Oracle SOA Suite, is an integrated, productive environment that is a leader in its category.
This includes the service-oriented development of applications, service-oriented integration of applications and IT systems, and business process management (BPM). The components of the suite benefit from common capabilities including a single deployment and management model, consistent tooling, end-to-end security, and unified metadata management.

Ready Due Diligence survey and audited Term Sheet for the Series B sequence of financing.
(UCM) Content Server is the foundation for a variety of Oracle content management products. It provides a     flexible, secure, centralized, web-based repository that manages all phases of the content life cycle: from creation and approval to publishing, searching, expiration, and archival or disposition. Every contributor throughout the organization can easily contribute content from native desktop applications, efficiently manage business content via rich library services, and securely access that content anywhere using a web browser. All content, regardless of content type, is stored in the web repository or database for management, reuse and access. While stored in the repository, all types of content-ranging from e-mail, discussions, documents, reports, spreadsheets and records to images, multimedia or other digital formats-receive the same set of fundamental core services.
Strong analytical and problem solving skills with the ability to set targets, design improvement plans and ascertain best methodologies.

I have strong data analysis skills along with using MS office and Word, Excel, and Outlook. I possess an incredible attention to detail.
Used the principals of OOP such as Inheritance, polymorphism, In contrast, using object-oriented analysis, design, and programming techniques, the focus remains on the real-world objects throughout the development cycle. Although there is no clear winner in object-oriented analysis an overlap between each of the three development steps. The analyst and the programmer are both interested in development of usable (and reusable) objects. These programming objects (referred to as class declarations), once tested and made available to other programmers, do not have to be retested and redesigned every time changes are made to the data layout.
Used Oracle for cash transactions that were to be reconciled &amp; received. These cash transactions were to be reconciled &amp; accounted from Oracle Receivables
The ApexLib Development Framework give you lot of possibilities to tweak and enhance your Oracle APEX application. The Oracle APEX Builder Plugin is a productivity and usability enhancement tool for the development environment of Oracle Application Express (APEX). It integrates with Firefox and Internet Explorer to put a wealth of new features to your favorite development tool. 
Used MySQL as a relational database management system (RDBMS) that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases.

Oracle Developer

AIM methodology, Oracle A.I.M. Methodology encompasses a project management methodology with documentation templates that support the life cycle of an implementation. The life cycle methodology and documentation templates allow A.I.M. to be a very useful tool for managing implementation projects successfully. The A.I.M. methodology can actually be used for any type IT software implementations however the value of A.I.M is within the documentation template. The software includes the documentation templates, manuals and an html website to manage these templates
Used Cursor processing which is a variable that runs through the tuples of some relation. This relation can be a stored table, or it can be the answer to some query. By fetching into the cursor each tuple of the relation, we can write a program to read and process the value of each such tuple. If the relation is stored, we can also update or delete the tuple at the current cursor position.
Oracle PL/SQL is a highly structured, strongly typed programming language that uses natural language constructs to make it easy to understand and use. 
PL/SQL combines the data-manipulating power of SQL with the processing power of procedural languages. You can control program flow with statements like IF and LOOP. As with other procedural programming languages, you can declare variables, define procedures and functions, and trap runtime errors.
PL/SQL lets you break complex problems down into easily understandable procedural code, and reuse this code across multiple applications. When a problem can be solved through plain SQL, you can issue SQL commands directly inside your PL/SQL programs, without learning new APIs. PL/SQL's data types correspond with SQL's column types, making it easy to interchange PL/SQL variables with data inside a table.
Used Oracle Agile in the supply chain re-engineering for end-to-end product lifecycle management (PLM) solution, Oracle's Agile PLM helps companies accelerate profitable innovation. Used Agile PLM to enables access to your Agile data via a service platform connected to your Agile server in a secured environment. To intuitive, familiar interface so you can be immediately productive. To view attachments from your device (.pdf, MS Office, .jpg and many others). To see the status of other approvers for the same change order and to works natively with your device's existing capabilities, so there is no need for any special programming.  
JOB TITLE: SYSTEM ANALYST:
BI Publisher data and report template development experience a Cognos is IBM's business intelligence (BI) and performance management software suite. The software is designed to enable business users without technical knowledge to extract corporate data, analyze it and assemble reports.  Cognos is composed of nearly three dozen software products. Because Cognos is built on open standards, the software products can be used with relational and multidimensional data sources from multiple vendors, including Microsoft, NCR Teradata.Oracle BI Publisher.
Used Cognos Express Reporter for ad hoc reporting.
Used Extract, transform and load (ETL) to extracting data from outside sources; transforming it to fit operational needs and loading it to fit operational needs used in data warehousing.
Oracle XML Publisher (XMLP) is Oracle Corporation's new reporting technology. It was originally developed to solve the reporting problems faced by Oracle Applications. It was first released with Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10 in 2003. XML Publisher Enterprise with no dependency on Oracle Applications. When XML Publisher became part of the Oracle BI Enterprise Edition Suite it was re-branded as Oracle BI Publisher. BI Publisher separates the creation of data (XML) from the process of formatting it for different uses. The engine can format any well-formed XML data, allowing integration with any system that can generate XML, including Web Services or any data source available through JDBC BI Publisher can merge multiple data sources into a single output document.
During an Oracle Applications implementation, additional configuration, design, or programming requirements are necessary to satisfy functional requirements and achieve the desired functionality. The objective during any implementation would be to keep new object development to an absolute minimum. RICE objects represent requirements not currently supported within the core functionality of an Oracle Application Module being implemented and thus require additional technical development to satisfy the functional requirement of a organization. During an Implementation development of RICE components involves:  Enhancements (or extensions) to the existing system to add additional functionality to existing system without disturbing the core software functionality of the system. 
I'm experienced in all phases of the system development life cycle from specifications, analysis, logical design, physical design, programming, testing, installation, documentation and user training.

EXPERIENCE

Nicor Gas, Naperville, IL	 01/01 - 10/07
Oracle Developer / Systems Administrator / Consultant
I used Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX) as a rapid web application development tool for the Oracle database. I supported Shell scripting in a UNIX setting; used basic UNIX commands like LS to list files. I also used OAF development which can be split in two major categories namely: Personalization refers to the ability to declaratively alter the UI to suit user or business needs and Extensibility refers to the ability to programmatically extend an application's functionality. Used Oracle Applications - Apps E-Business Suite (also known as Applications/Apps or EB-Suite/EBS) to collect enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and supply-chain management (SCM) computer applications either developed by or acquired by Oracle. Worked on testing AP, AR, GL, FA, CE and other financial modules. Worked with CC&amp;B Customer Care &amp; Billing System in a UNIX environment; accessed Oracle table through the use of structure and efficient SQL. I used BizTalk to promote XML as the common data exchange language for e-commerce and application integration on the Internet. Worked in a TSO/ISPF environment. 

Prior to this I worked as a Programmer Analyst for Allstate, Motorola, Caremark and Metpath doing maintenance, updates to and creation of application software using Cobol,CICS,DB2 and mainframes. I used SAS and utilities to accomplish my work/assignments.

	Human Resources Assistant II


To Whom It May Concern,
I am actively seeking an employment opportunity anywhere south of New York! Almost 10 years ago I was given an opportunity when Kaiser was bought out to move with the company to Syracuse, New York as a Tool and Process Designer. Prior to that my career had been primarily on the shop floor learning everything from welding, cnc machining, tooling and just about everything in between. I have been programming part for the past year and I am really enjoying the challenge of learning new things. I have strong experience with troubleshooting and I enjoy figuring out the problem solving tasks.
I enjoy my job at TactAir, but my heart and the heart of my family is in the south. I would love the chance to learn something new and use my strengths in a way that my employer is satisfied and I know that I have done the best of my capability.
I trust you will contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration,

Tim Bingham
8412 Sextant Drive * Baldwinsville, NY 13027 * (315)944-7293 *t_bingham@rocketmail.com
Tim Bingham
Objective
Being in manufacturing for over 23 years and in aerospace for over 13, I have had the pleasure to see and implement new and transformational ideas in tooling and manufacturing processes. From drafting tables to 3D printers the excitement of what tomorrow brings keeps me seeking for the next new technology and longing to be part of it. I feel there is a need for persons with the working knowledge of an engineer and the machining experience to put such knowledge into fruition on the shop floor. Solving issues on the shop floor is my passion. I have really enjoyed the opportunity given to me in New York but would love to end my career as a programmer back home in the south.

I am an experienced software developer seeking a position building innovative, enterprise level
Java and Web applications. My strong development background and wide variety of skills gives
me the ability to pick up and apply new technologies quickly. My ideal company would have an
appreciation for multi-faceted, creative developers. A final product should reflect the developers
and architects behind it.

    Grew and supported 1000's of JSP pages, and peer Java code on a provisioning server, that
    allows access and updates to a large TimesTen/Oracle database. All pages follow a common
    pattern of read, update, and write current values. Simple form validation was done on the
    browser, and all business logic resides on the server.
    Added to the XML schema, consisting of 1000's of complex types, that defines the
    provisioning API. Extended the provisioning API Java code within a highly optimized, layered
    business logic-to-database level framework. The process included peer review of all
    functional specifications and code. Used Java, Javascript, JSP, HTML/CSS, XML, XSLT,
    XML Schema, XMLBeans, TimesTen/Oracle SQL.
    Wrote servlets to support REST style requests to provision users in the database. Also wrote
    test pages for each transaction using AJAX within the Prototype.js framework.
    Supported and extended a SOAP transport of the provisioning XML schema; the different
    payload simply required use of a different communication path on towards the provisioning
    server.

(1998 &#173; April/2005)

    Wrote the final 90% of and assisted with the implementation of a high speed scanner
    application and operator GUI (using Swing), for Florida Medicaid, which processed over
    300,000 health care claims per day, generating gigabytes of mainframe-generated report data
    per week. The GUI allowed the operator to control all aspects of the setup and operation,
    minimizing operator error from manual control. It is my understanding this application and
    GUI are still used by Florida Medicaid.
    Designed, wrote and assisted in testing and implementing a CD-ROM Jukebox storage and
    retrieval subsystem for large volumes of document image, EDI, and report data. This
                                                                                         Page 1 of 2

   repository provided access to claim data over the Internet to thousands of state government
   and fiscal agent employees, and to over 80,000 healthcare providers. Also designed and
   wrote a separate Swing GUI to control and monitor the Jukebox, using RMI to communicate
   with it.
   Designed and wrote an HTML forms based EDI generator. The user enters health care
   information over multiple web pages, with supplied, optional, and required fields. A servlet
   then correlates that (possibly sparse) data with an XML description of the target EDI
   transaction, and generates syntactically valid EDI.
   Designed and wrote an EDI syntax validator using Rhino Javascript embedded in a Java
   application. This was driven by an XML description of each EDI transaction type.
   Designed and wrote an IBM Host On Demand screen scraper. This automatically steps
   through a complex screen hierarchy extracting predetermined fields and saving them to
   LotusNotes.
   Prototyped an IVR script interpreter of a small language similar to VoiceXML. Designed and
   wrote an IVR application, and web access, to the Commonwealth of VA Self-Service
   Employee Benefits Eligibility System (BES). This system supports approximately 120,000
   Commonwealth employees and retirees, and enables them to access their benefits
   information from the web or a telephone. This system used Nuance V-Builder and Voice Web
   Server, with voice recognition and voice print security, interacting with a UNISYS mainframe.
   Designed and wrote PDF report generators to summarize EDI transaction history, using
   iReport to visually layout the report and generate an XML description, and JasperReports
   (with iText) to generate the PDF.


Senior Design Engineer,   General Electric Information Services,     Rockville, MD
(1988 &#173; 1998)

   Wrote and assisted in developing several protocol converters between SNA LU6.2 and the
   GEIS proprietary network, in IBM Assembler and `C'.
   Wrote an HTML form based Perl CGI to monitor 24x7 GEIS-hosted applications through a V-
   One firewall.

Dear Sir or Madam,

My last job was working for GE's Power &amp; Energy Division in Engineering, through Adecco Technical, where I worked as a composition operator, working directly with engineers preparing proposals and contracts for wind, thermal and gas projects worldwide. Before GE, I worked as a product support specialist for a software company that makes software for Adobe. I set up and demo this product for clients all over the world. I am looking for work full time or on a contract level. 

I have been designing and directing for 20 years in every phase of advertising for non-profits, artists, arts and woman's groups, museums, historic groups, along with a long list of very prestigious companies and organizations, including recently JP Morgan Chase and the Woodstock Historical Society and Film Festival. 

I am currently attending SUNY ESC to complete my BS, majoring in Information Technology.

I have enclosed a resume and samples for your perusal. If you should have any questions or concerns, or should need more samples, please call or email.

DEAR HIRING MANAGER:

Viewing the job posting on your website, I feel I can be a vital employee to your clients, your projects, and as a colleague. Pursuing
two degrees in Economics, and Political Science with concentrations in accounting and finance exemplifies my determination and
drive that would be an asset to your company and your long term goals. During my time at the university, I have honed my time
management skills, academic and analytical research capabilities, organizational capacity to allow me to participate in many orga-
nizations regarding finance and economics, as well as keeping my university coursework in check. I am also in the midst of prepar-
ing myself for the CFA Level 1 exam, and the CPA exam which I plan to complete in 2013. As a recent graduate with relevant course
experience, I am seeking a position pertinent to my education, passion, and natural abilities. I am driven and eager to launch my
career in a field where I can join a team to serve the interest of the public and greater community.

My passion and drive for the finance and accounting fields came to life when I worked as an executive assistant for the Gilbert
Quinones Law Firm, where I was soon promoted to the Staff Accountant position. As an intern my duties involved assistance to
all counselors prepare general ledgers of accounts payable, accounts receivable and prepare timely bank reconciliations. As my
administrative assistant tasks I was able to increase office efficiency and productivity my introducing new forms of accounting
software as well as filing systems that allowed the office to work in a more harmonious environment. As the staff accountant I was
in charge of assisting many projects that included a cross-department collaboration; wherein I assisted in business plans expand-
ing the firm by managing relations between the IT, Finance, Research and Development departments in this multi-disciplinary
project I was exposed project management and business strategies and communication skills. My time at the firm was extremely
rewarding when the firm adopted my ac- counting, and filing systems I knew that my thought and input meant something to
the company. I was proud of the part of the projects I was involved with and I know that my contributions for the company were
meaningful, a feeling that I would love to experience again.

During my time at PM Entertainment LLC, I was exposed to the entertainment industry and the operations of hierarchal firms. I
was in charge of budgeting analysis and forecasting expenditures for PM Productions, Distribution, and Parallel Media, all subsid-
iary companies. I learned negotiation procedures for the Directors Guild of America as well as a wide variety of vendors in dealing
with pre, and post productions of a film. I learned how to manage multiple firms' finances by generating weekly and monthly
reports presented to my supervisors, financiers, and investors. I gained the knowledge of strenuous multi-tasking firms' decisions
and business plans, as well as being immaculate with every report and interpretation I generated. Not only was I exposed to the
finance and accounting side of this industry, but I was also in charge of paralegal assistance to the attorneys on hand. I lead many
projects dealing with the financial discovery of employee and plaintiff/defendant audits to be used as viable pieces of evidence
within cases. My time spent at this firm was an invaluable experience that will help me on my future endeavors in the financial and
legal aspects of my career.

The combination of my clientele experience, along with my accounting, and financial analysis, and legal experience has strength-
ened my enthusiasm for a career in a field where all can be utilized to my optimal utility. I have also discovered that I excel at
working independently, under stress, and collaboratively with members from different disciplines. I am eager to take what I have
learned and apply both my academic and professional knowledge to where results can make a real change.

I believe that with my strong work ethic and professional skills in a nurturing and competitive environment, I can make immediate
and lasting contributions. If you are looking for a motivated and dedicated team player, please contact me at (310) 913-9011 or at
alexanderdeluna@gmail.com.

Sincerely yours,


Alexander De Luna

Development of white papers and testing procedures as well as lectures for prospective clients as well as trade shows. Reported to the President and presented weekly updates of various projects based on project plans and budget updates for investors.
Some of the major components of the solution were an identity management backbone constructed through a BI policy filter which made calls to a cipher broker based upon a HSM card for security.

DoD (Sandia): Installed two different configuration management systems. The first system was allowed to use dhcp so I integrated with the pxe boot for loading various server images at boot time other additions/subtractions were done by a scheduled cron job deploying to the server. The second was a static ip based configuration management system, because of security, in this sub infrastructure I was able to push configurations based on xml data which held the configuration data for the specific servers to be configured.

AAFES: Oversaw a team from IBM to develop and integrate a new POS system for all PX?s worldwide. Though the project was able to direct to staffing the required skill sets needed by the project and time frame of each task due to the ability to understand and bring together the business requirements and the complex infrastructure already in place. Since placing the right technical skill at the right time on site was able to shorten development and deployment.

Experience

Senior Maintenance Developer
Duties for this position included diagnosis and correction of pre-existing defects in the software and re-writing the programs as deemed necessary. Changes to documentation were also part of the responsibility.
 
Drug Accountability V3.0
Personnaly corrected xx number of defects out of xxx.
This package provides functionality to maintain a perpetual inventory of drugs. Interfacing with the Generic Inventory Package (GIP) and the prime vendors. Invoice data increments drug balances in pharmacy locations and master vaults. Pharmacy's dispensing software packages pass dispensing data to Drug Acountability which decrements the drug balances in pharmacy locations.

Controlled Substances V3.0
The Controlled Substances (CS) software package is one segment of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) installed at VA medical centers. The Controlled Substances module provides functionality to monitor and track the receipt, inventory, and dispensing of all controlled substances. This module provides the pharmacy with the capability to define a controlled substance location and a list of controlled substances to maintain a perpetual inventory.

This software provides the capability for pharmacy personnel to receive a Controlled Substances order, automatically update the quantity on hand, and view a receipt history. Nursing personnel are provided with the ability to request orders for Controlled Substances via on-demand requests. Pharmacy may dispense controlled substances via the software automating all necessary documents (VA FORMS 10-2321 and 10-2638) to complete an order request. The software provides functionality to record AMIS and Cost data, address returns to stock, destructions, order cancellations, transfers between locations, and log outpatient prescriptions.

Pharmacy Prescription Practice V1.0
I received quarterly updates via diskette that contained all information related to Veterans' visits to each VA Medical Center. Through my software, a physician could determine when/if the patient had been to other facilities. This reduced the chances over over medication or substance abuse. This package was retired in March of 2009.
