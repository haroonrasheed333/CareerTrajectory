<professional>Technical Experiences
<description>Finite element analysis and mechanical design of stress, thermal and fracture/fatigue
· Developed an innovative model to predict the thermo-mechanical relaxation of shot peening
   induced compressive residual stresses on aircraft engine blade surface.
· As a team member, developed a physics-based lifing prediction tool for aircraft engine high-
   pressure turbine blades. The work received Energy and Propulsion Technologies Awards for
   Business Impact Project of 2009 at GE Global Research Center.
· Developed a design tool to predict heat treatment, machining and pre-spin induced residual
   stresses in gas turbine disks.
· Developed finite element models to validate different design concepts for preventing the
  trailing edge cracking of Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) vanes.
· Designed and measured the thermal mechanical aspects of high-power light-emitting diode
   (LED) structures.
· Managed the development of LED street light
· Developed a novel program in ANSYS to automatically generate 3D integrated circuit
   structures based on 2D layout to simulate processing induced stress field in CMOS transistors.
· Developed a novel model to simulate the ultra-high temperature laser anneal induced warpage
   and viscoplastic deformation of integrated structures.
· Developed analytical and finite element models to understand temperature cycling induced
   passivation film cracking and excessive plastic deformation of metal pads in microelectronic
   interconnect structures.
· Built finite element models to study buckling behavior of crystal fiber in polymeric matrix
   under Herzian contact loading.
· Developed the creep-assistant slow crack growth model to understand the loading rate effects on
  the fatigue behavior of ceramic/polymer multilayered structures.
· Developed models to study water absorption and foundation creep induced stress evolution and
  cracking formation in ceramic/polymer multilayered structures.
· Studied the warpage effects on the solder joint fatigue in flip chip structures.
· Proposed and designed functionally graded interface to reduce water absorption, foundation
  creep and contact induced stresses in ceramic/polymer multilayers.
· Analyzed and measured residual stresses in blood vessels.

Multi-physics analysis
· Led the design of novel structures to optimize the electric performance improvement by relaxed
  SiGe layer and contact-etch stop layer in strained CMOS transistors and to prevent mechanical
  failures.
· Systematically studied the stress effects on the performance of optical waveguides, and
  designed novel packaging structures to engineer thermal stresses in optical micro-waveguides to
  control the birefringence, transition loss and temperature sensitivity of photonic devices.

Experimental skills
· Measured the thermal and optical performance of high power LED emitters.
· Built experimental systems to study the contact fatigue of ceramic/polymer multilayered
  structures, and measured the creep properties of polymer and the interfacial fracture toughness
  of ceramic/cement interface.
· Measured the yield strength and bonding strength of different epoxies to bond the optical fiber
  with silicon chip.
· Fabricated electronic packaging structures, and measured the warpage and mechanical
  properties of underfills and Printed Circuit Board.</description></professional>
