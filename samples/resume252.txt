<description>Worked on the Decru data encryption devices developing test cases, testing and building
an automation infrastructure.
	 Designed and coded a 60,000 line automation software project to execute the QA test
cases for a SAN based encryption product. The project was coded in Perl 5.x in a Linux
environment. Heavy use was made of the SANBlaze FC emulator and APCON FC switch to
facilitate a totally automated testing environment.
	 Designed and coded an application using the SANBlaze FC emulator to verify the SCSI
protocol as commands were passed into and data and status retrieved from the NetApp
encryption device. This allowed verification that the device was not corrupting SCSI
commands.
	 Wrote all the QA test cases for a new encryption project and setup the necessary lab
equipment for the testing of the  new product. I also introduced the SANBlaze FC emulator
to the company to help automate the testing process and reduce hardware overhead in the
data center.
	 Wrote all the test cases necessary to achieve Common Criteria certification for the SAN
based encryption product.</description></job>

	 <description>Designed and coded in C using the Eagle emulator, an error injection project. Software
on the Eagle was written to emulate a SCSI hard disc. The software had a user interface to
allow modifications to the SCSI protocol so as to induce errors during SCSI activity. Such
injected errors helped identify faults in the SCSI HBA and drivers. This project allowed
verification that the Adaptec HBA and device driver were properly handling the SCSI
protocol.
	 Developed test cases to test Adaptec SCSI and FC HBAs and drivers in a Netware
environment.
	 Tested SCSI HBAs &amp; drivers for Windows NT and Netware.</description></job>

	 <description>Provided a complete redesign of the MTC tape sub-system to use SCSI 9-track tape units
and added software support for a large variety of tape format standards. The MTC machine
produced microfiche from corporate data taken from financial institutions and stored on 9-
track tape in a variety of tape format standards.
	 Designed a 7 tape streaming tape sub-system to replace the single tape sub-system. This
provided increased data transfer and reduced latency due to operator intervention.</description></job>

	 <description>Designed Multibus-I boards using a variety of Intel microprocessors and micro
controllers The design process included doing the schematic capture, working with PCB
layout engineers and PCB fabricators. I also built the prototypes, wrote the bring-up
software for the boards using either assembler or C languages and did the entire hardware
debugging. Following debug, I brought the board product into full production which
included writing all the diagnostic software for the test lab.
	 Developed software for the test lab to test and repair the boards. Software was written
either in assembler, C or PLM/86. Test applications were sometimes ROM based and sometimes
operating system applications.
	 Developed device drivers for the board products for the Intel iRMX operating system in
addition to my work writing test software. The iRMX operating system was an RTOS from
Intel which required a kernel re-build for each new device driver in a manner similar to
Unix.

	 <description>My responsibility was to build and test PDP-11 based communication multiplexors. I
would work with parts vendors to acquire all components of a project including cabinets,
power supplies, cables, fans, ICs, boards and software. I would build each unit and test
it for functionality.
	 To assist my efforts I wrote test and diagnostic software for the multiplexors. Using
PDP-11 assembler, I wrote tests for all functions of the multiplexors to assist in
building and diagnosing the device.</description></job></experience>
