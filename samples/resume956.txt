<description>Assistant Plant Breeder (Tomatoes)

Evaluation and selections in early generation tomato breeding populations; introgression breeding work.  I am responsible for field evaluation of the F2, F3 and F4 Ketchup breeding lines.  I design field crosses to introduce new and/or under represented traits into high viscosity ketchup breeding lines while maintaining peel and dice characteristics.  

I am proficient using a Microsoft Access database, which includes entering data and generating reports.  I organize the seed room and provide materials in accordance with planting plans.  I am the liaison between the Breeders and the Greenhouse and the Molecular Lab.  I manage trial seed distribution for the global tomato breeding program.  I help prepare and plant trials in the central valley of California.

<description>Molecular Geneticist (Post-doc)
Conducted a molecular genetic analysis of milling yield in progeny of long grain rice cv. Cypress by phenotyping and generating AFLP and SSR markers by PCR.  Mapped molecular markers and QTL positions.  Created stepwise regression models of traits involved with milling yield of rice.  Initiated the purchase, testing and implementation of image analysis hardware and software that increased the degree of detail to which rice kernels could be phenotyped.  Wrote protocols that allowed generation of uniform data while screening kernel characteristics related to milling yield. 
Mapped Molecular Markers and Identified QTLs markers
Used forward regression statistical analysis in evaluation of rice milling yield
Initiated the purchase, testing and implementation of image analysis equipment
Developed a protocol that reduced labor needed to evaluate milling yield by ~50%</description></job>
