<description>ShoreTel is the provider of brilliantly simple Unified Communications(UC) solutions based on it's IP business phone system. With UC solution, enterprises trade complexity for plug-and-play simplicity in integrated voice, video, data, and mobile communication.
My current role is to lead on development efforts and manage following projects:

 1. Distributed Workgroups Implementation:

ShoreTel Workgroups Server works in similar fashion as call center application infrastructure where it runs on server platform, provides call routing, announcements, scheduling, and reporting. It has pretty much all features found in any regular call center software including call queueing, ACD, agent's call handling, conferencing etc.. 
Responsibilities:
       Initially Workgroup Server was built to run stand alone application which was limited to run on main server and had further limitations on managing agents' locations, centralized call control, CDR data delivery; I redesigned and refactored code to make distributable to remote servers in multi-location sites in cloud. This resulted in running servers locally as well without affecting WAN outage or utilizing network resources. The application is designed run as service on Windows platform and daemon on Linux, written in C++ utilizing OOPs paradigm, multithreaded to handle &amp; process telephony activities as well as database triggers with heavy load. 

Environment:  Wind River Workbench, MSVC 2005, Perforce, Linux, Win 2003/2008.

2. Double-Take/Vision Solutions High Availability Integration:

Double-Take is world's leading provider for high availability software to support disaster recovery. ShoreTel provides the ability to have one active Shoreware Server and a hot standby server. With two servers configuration, one acts as Source and another as Target. Double-Take software running on Target server monitors on Source and when some catastrophe situation happens like hardware failure, WAN outage, it brings up ShoreTel service on Target immediately to avoid any interruption in operations and finally Target server takes over.

Responsibilities:
My work was to lead the effort, work with Double-Take team and develop workflow for ShoreTel's core product with help of internal engineers for related components to integrate both software together. This integration ended up in redesigning some of the modules and extensive work with other team including MySQL replication implementation &amp; provide solution to customers. 

Environment:  Windows 2003/2008, Scripting (JavaScript), MySQL.
  
3. XMPP Presence &amp; IM Server:

Led the team in acquisition of XMPP server source code base from other company Eyeball Networks Inc., performed requirement analysis, design, and integration to fit in our core product's need. This resulted in redesigning their database usage from MySQL to SQLite, customized several other components like offline message storage, buddy management, data for CDRs etc..

Environment:  C++, Wind River Workbench, Perforce, Linux.</description></job>
