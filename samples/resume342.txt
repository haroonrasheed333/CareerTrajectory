Senior Design Team Leader: 5/2008 to 5/2010
Coordinate with team members, faculty and professional engineers to design auxiliary spillway for Hyrum Dam to meet 100 year flood and other regulations.  Create calculation sheets, gather information as preliminary work, and communicate with Army Corp Engineers to determine boundaries of design. We proposed to install a Fuse Plug in an alternate spillway as the design.  Hydrologic analysis of the subbasin of Hyrum Reservoir and soil classification was performed using HEC-HMS to determine Probable Maximum Flood (PMF). Hydraulic analysis of the existing spillway was done as well as our proposed Fuse Plug analysis.  Then the embankment design was created using studies of Fuse Plug's and SLIDE program. Social and political issues were considered with the project. Cost estimates of construction, materials, and operation were calculated also. Lead in presenting and organizing presentation and report in behalf of team.</description></school>
