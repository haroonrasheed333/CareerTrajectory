<professional>COURSE PROJECTS:
<description>Undergraduate studies:
  Undertook final year project on &quot;manufacture of polyurethane&quot; in BASF India ltd. Trained as a process engineer for a period
     of one year. This project included the Study of the entire process optimization of the process and further modifications applied
     to improve the existing properties of the polymer. Extensive research on the uses and application of polyurethane in various
     fields and also the various methods of production adopted for the manufacture of this polymer was also carried out as a part of
     this project.
 Graduate studies:
  sensor technology: Carried out a project on multiplexed nanowire sensor arrays. Studied the structural aspects of nanowire
     sensors in the form of arrays and suggested modifications in the design. Studied the usage of sensor arrays in cancer detection.
  impact of materials on environment: carried out a study on impact of plastic and paper containers on the environment and
     suggested modifications in the manufacturing techniques of the two to reduce energy and raw material consumption.
  tissue engineering: reducing bio degradation of polymeric materials used in biomedical applications (status-on going)</description></professional>
