<description>Virtual Lifetime Electronic Records, VLER, is an initiative for the exchange of healthcare information being developed under the auspices of the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (OI&amp;T) as part of the Nationwide Health Information Network. One of the primary purposes of VLER is to streamline medical and administrative recordkeeping. With VLER, Service members and Veterans health information can be shared with their care providers and benefits administrators as part of a secure information exchange. This eliminates current practice of sharing records through physical means. By providing a common access point for all records, VLER will result in:  more efficient processing of benefits, better informed clinicians, service, and care providers; improved continuity and timeliness of care; enhanced awareness among all involved parties; and elimination of gaps in records. I am part of Project Management team for Direct and Partner Integration. The Direct project, which has been termed a scaled down version of the NwHIN, allows two trusted entities (a physician and a referred specialist for instance) to share medical records. The Partner Integration project provides the ability for the Veteran to consent to share their information across the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN). Allowing national access to the Veteran's health information through the VA partnership with private healthcare providers is critically important. This solution benefits the Veteran by giving the Veteran and their families, access to shared information between the partnerships. More importantly it provides important real-time updates regarding VA patients and their families between the VA and their partners in the network.
