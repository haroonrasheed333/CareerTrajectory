<description>The SetFocus SQL Server Master's Program is an intensive, hands-on, project oriented program where participants gain knowledge and valuable experience putting the SQL Server skill set to use in a simulated work environment.
Created numerous simple to complex queries involving self joins, correlated subqueries, CTE's and XML techniques for diverse business requirements. Tuned and optimized queries by altering database design, analyzing different query options, and indexing strategies.
As part of a team, analyzed the business requirements and systematically designed a database for an online-movie (DVD/Blu-Ray) rental company. Employed best practices in creating a complete schema including tables, relationships, stored procedures, views, clustered and non-clustered indexes and triggers, and implemented the import and export of data using XML and SSIS. 
As part of a team, created various reports according to the business requirements for the movie rental company. Individually authored, installed, deployed and managed reports using SSRS for a library database. 
Individually designed a bank application according to business requirements, and implemented robust stored procedures, functions, and triggers to implement required functionalities. 
Created an ETL solution that reads Product, Vendor, and Order data from .CSV files on a network share into a SQL Server database.  The solution also validated incoming data and performed notifications when jobs complete.  The order data thus loaded into SQL Server was used to generate reports using the new SSRS 2008 reporting functionality (including the Tablix control).  The reports were set up for automatic delivery based on standard report subscriptions.
