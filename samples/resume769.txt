--<description>Experimental and computational mechanics of biological materials
Developed predictive mechanical models in LabVIEW environment to investigate the functional characteristic of mineralized tissues in bending, providing a novel architecture for biomimetic design. 
Validated predictive models by applying microscopy imaging techniques to nondestructively visualize and calculate the internal strain throughout specimen under bending.
Addressed the core task of micro bending analysis for biological tissue by developing novel testing system using mechanical designing tools (Solidworks).
Built and maintained a suite of LabVIEW Virtual instruments that control and acquire data from a series of complex biomechanical tests, including quasi-static compression test, stress relaxation test, four-point bending test and low speed impact (percussion) test.
Evaluated non-linear mechanics of both soft and hard biological tissue by regression modeling experimental data with anisotropic constitutive models. 
Designed and fabricated biomimetic materials from inspiration of structures of biological materials.

--Development of laser assisted crack detection technology/ Metallurgical testing /Failure analysis
Assisted Metro Laser, Inc. to create a laser fatigue crack detection technology based on sensing surface roughness from intensity of reflective laser light. 
Designed and conducted fatigue tests with metals based on fully automated MTS testing system.
Assisted with installation of portable Laser instruments for generating and collecting optical signal during fatigue tests. 
Performed fatigue failure analysis using replica techniques and electron microscopes (SEM and TEM).
Provided feedback to MetroLaser, Inc. for improvement of crack detection efficiency.

--Finite element modeling for stress analysis
Performed FEA using commercial software (MSC Marc) to predict the mechanical response of human teeth under impact loads.
Analyzed how microcracks affect stress distribution within human teeth under dynamic loading using FEM. 

--Engineering &amp; Research Leadership
Trained and advised multiple undergraduate researchers in fields of mechanical testing and modeling.
 Assisted with the setup and maintenance of research facility including automated MTS test system, Environmental SEM, Rockwell hardness tester, etc.</description></job>
