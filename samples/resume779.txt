Project Description

Company has decided to re-platform the current Valuation application i.e. Valuescope from a mainframe platform to a JEE based open system implementation. At a high level  Valuescope® Claim Services provide Fast, Accurate, Local Market Value® information for total loss vehicles, including extensive, in-depth VIN information. The system will arrive at the value of a total loss vehicle, before the loss happened by following a complex set of processes, which includes comparing the vehicle with standard vehicles as well as vehicles specific to local geography native to the loss vehicle.

Project Objectives:

1.	Create interface forVIN Decode
2.	Create database and load the  data's from Chrome interface .
3. 	Create interface called as CVINA and populate the CRV data's.
4.	Decode VIN and YMM value and show the relevant vehicle information to user.

This project is not restricted to individual products -- all products and states will be impacted.

Project Description

The project objective is Revise Auto Link Online links to route all the Online forms to Documaker as opposed to static document links. Update the Forms Gateway to route documents to Documaker instead of the AutoLink Forms Component. Update AutoLink Print/View Doc page to reflect tabular page viewReprint Submitted Transactions Link to Print/View Policy Documents Screen.  This applies to new business only. Project Background:

Cash processors currently use stand-alone applications to process payments made through AutoLink by Agents through their sweep accounts and make adjustments to commission statements.  These applications are written in an unsupported language (Visual Basic 6) and rely on an unsupported database (SQL Server 6.5).  This project will provide a way for Cash processors to process this information using technologies which are supported by java and J2ee technologies.

This requirement documents the rewrite of the Agent Sweep system.

Project Objectives:

1.	Create interface for Cash Processors to list transactions, add credits, add debits, and 
	balance transactions to agent sweep accounts.
2.	Create database to store agent sweep transactions.
3. 	Create interface for Agent LagProcessors to list transactions, add,delete and 
	search transactions to agent lag transactions.
4.	Create the batch files for Sweep Transactions and create the Error report.

This project is not restricted to individual products -- all products and states will be impacted.

Project Description

SCB China intended to offer ATM services for its customers. To fast track the implementation,
SCB China has taken approach to leverage on the ATM/Debit card functionality offered in SCB Indonesia with some exception. The exception is to offer additional functionality to match the local banking industry standard offering for ATM/Debit Card services in China.
The ATM/Debit transactions are differentiated between SCB ATM and Other ATM with same city and cross city segregation to impose different charge type.
The ATM/Debit card functionality is to support the debit account in RMB currency and the transaction currency in RMB currency - within China,
For transaction outside China, the debit account will be in RMB and debit amount also in RMB equivalent if the transaction currency is in foreign currency. The currency conversion will be done by service provider and transparent to eBBS
Euronet [Switch] will differentiate the type of Debit/ATM card transaction and send the related transaction code with an indicator (same city, cross city). The same city and cross city classification is based Debit Account Home Branch and ATM / Branch POS Location used for the transaction.
Euronet to store the branch code for all eBBS subsidiary accounts captured during the registration process. A table mapping required in Euronet to group branch code to a city and also the ATMs and Branch POS to a city. The maintenance of these tables will be handled manually within Euronet application. In eBBS, the two transaction codes will be defined for same transaction type to differentiate the Debit/ATM Card transactions as follows:
a.         From Local ATM Transaction  
b.  	From Switch Network Transaction.
