<description>Primary technical lead dedicated to Gateway Vector (Invitrogen/Life Sciences) cloning.    Position is charged with primer design, PCR, Sequencing, and sequence analysis.  Primary accomplishments are the introduction of a resistance marker (Bla promoter/gene) into a Gateway Vector (pEG100 and pEG301) that allowed for a new antibiotic resistance screening for plant transformation.  The other accomplishment is the optimization of a Site Directed Ligase Independent inverse PCR method to remove a resistance gene while inserting new restriction sites (performed in a single, extended PCR cycle) for the inclusion of a single point mutated gene inferring new resistance to the vector and utilizing the existing promoter and terminator regions.  Additional roles: Manager of the T-DNA (Salk Lines) and c-DNA Library.  Assistant to Post-Doctorial lab members giving support towards meeting their individual target goals (Cloning, Bacterial transformation, Mini and Midi preps, genomic DNA extractions, genotyping).  The position also allows me to work with Primary Investigators across multiple disciplines and to directly assist in reaching their research project goals.</description></job>

<description>Primary lead on molecular study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with focus on *-Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and mAPOE (Apolipoprotein E) 5' promoter region. Created serial deletion constructs of the mAPOE gene 5' regulatory region followed by transient transfection of constructs in various mammalian cell lines to evaluate functional characteristics (i.e. up-regulation and down-regulation regions). Independently assessed the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors and novel compounds on APP processing in mammalian cell lines. Conducted RNA analysis of decreased protein expression levels in relationship to mode of action study.    Optimized hAPP ELISA to various mammalian cell lines to improve evaluation parameters. Initiated and maintained cell culture lines (e.g. PC12, C6, SKNSH, HeLa, and Mv1Lu) used in protein expression/transfection assays. Additional roles:  Primary laboratory radiation safety officer.  Directly involved in mentoring incoming graduate students and part time staff in applicable molecular methods and laboratory safety.</description></job></experience>
