Starting as an enterprise direct sales representative, I transitioned to an enterprise carrier representative and currently I am the Western regional sales manager focusing on California, Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. I have delivered consistent sales results through effective partner management.  
My progression and development at Blackberry has aligned with the corporate priorities and growth initiatives.  In addition, due to my unique and highly effective sales management techniques, RIM has utilized me for international projects taking me to the UK, Scotland and Canada.
