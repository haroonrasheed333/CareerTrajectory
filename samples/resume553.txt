         * <description>Prepared a comprehensive, competitive analysis on other regional and national financial institutions within the bank's footprint, which focused on improving the bank's retail and commercial account product lines. I currently sit on the product development committee with other senior management.  Our goal is to design a new product line that remains competitive with other banks' product lines while increasing profitability and uniformity. The product line has been approved by executive management and will soon be piloted at the K Street branch.
         *Increased traffic into K Street branch by designing a fully compliant message board, which displays mortgage rates and various other deposit, and loan offers. The branch is now averaging five loan referrals per week with several million dollars in approved loans. Due to the success and high ROI, this marketing effort has been launched at other branches within the institution. In an effort to increase cross selling of deposit products to new mortgage clients, I created a promotional campaign offering appraisal refunds in an effort to gain full banking relationships through setting guidelines to qualify.  In addition, I produced a flyer to be given by the branch, mailed to customers and potential customers, and/or presented at the closing of the loan expressing the details of the promotion. 
         * Designed spreadsheets used by bank personnel to estimate earnings credits for clients placed in commercial analysis accounts. These spreadsheets were designed not only for back office use but also for use as a sales presentation tool.
         * Developed business by meeting with potential clients and helping them with their deposit and loan needs.</description></job>
