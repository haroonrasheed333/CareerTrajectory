Fourth, from developing budgets and performing analysis work, I maintain my technical accounting skills sharp with hands-on experience.</summary>      

PLEASE NOTE:  <objective>My absence from the workforce has been the result of a sluggish economy and changes in employer's preferences for experience coupled with advanced degrees.

I assure you that you should have no concern of any lack of recent work experience or lack of technical skills.  It is vital that you understand my absence has not affected my ability or judgment to execute the responsibilities and duties of this position.
