Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3                                                    October 2010 ­ October 2011
          My primary job was to record, edit, process, and integrate vocal talent into the game, but I also 
             did field recordings, foley sessions, sound design, and even temporary vocal acting for a large 
             portion of the game. 
          I worked with Developers, Level Designers, Animators, and other departments to fine tune the 
             audio for the needs of different environments and moods.</description></job>

<description>Various Projects                                                                             July 2005  Present
          I most recently worked with Green Power Resource Management, providing them with 3D 
             animated videos to help market various products. (www.greenprm.com) 
          I am currently editing audio and video for independent films to be entered into competitions and 
             film festivals. 
          I have done web design for Randy Mantooth (www.randolphmantooth.com).  I created the 
             website with an online form, allowing clients to book Randy for speaking engagements more 
             easily.  This made the number of bookings quadruple in just one year. 
          I have worked with the Los Angeles County Fire Department creating websites for events like 
             &quot;Pioneers of Paramedicine&quot;.  I have also created artwork used in the promotion of their Los 
             Angeles County Fire Museum project. 
          I have done video editing for JNR, inc. in Irvine, CA.  I was able to digitally capture video and 
             audio, as well as edit both for content and length.  The finished products matched video 
             transitions to music and flowed smoothly from beginning to end within the requested time 
             limits.   I provided multiple digital video format types, allowing maximum quality for uses in 
             Powerpoint marketing presentations and streaming online video.</description></job>

          <description>I used AutoCAD, Solidworks, and FabriWin to create assembly drawings (2D and 3D), and flat 
             layouts for sheet metal projects.  I had to be able to draw parts and assemblies to the exact 
             specifications given by the customer, give detailed bill of materials to the shop foreman, and 
             keep track of revisions to these drawings and materials lists. 
          I wrote a program to assist with calculating bend allowances of various metals. 
          I operated and maintained an Omax waterjet cutting machine, and trained others to do so as 
             well. 
          Another role of my position was Quality Assurance Manager.  I checked quantities and 
             dimensions of finished products to make sure that they matched the drawings exactly. 
          I also served as the company hardware/software technician, keeping JLMC up to date in a 
             constantly advancing industry.  My ability to quickly learn new software, coupled with my 
             knowledge of mechanical and computer hardware, allowed JLMC to continuously take on more 
             complex projects. 
          I was responsible for maintaining the company website. (www.jlmc.com)</description></job></experience>
