<description>Studies include general courses as well as Pre-Calculus, Advanced Chemistry and Computer Science courses.</description>

<courses>Computer Science Course I &amp; II 
While in high school I have studied of several contemporary languages such as C++, Assembly, Scheme/LISP, Visual Basic, Java, HTML, ASP, CGI, and Perl, with emphasis on differences in structure and application. Within Java language components were stressed as well as other topics such as decision making, looping, arrays, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, Java collections, sorting, searching, and case studies. My courses allowed me to study programming methodology and design, data structures, and algorithms. Upon completion of the course I have had an extensive introduction to the language of Java, completing assignments using many Java environments to ensure mastery of those topics.</courses>

<description>Orchestra - Third year, proficient in viola, cello and piano. 

Basketball - Third year, Captain of Junior Varsity 

Robotics - Learned the principles of mechanical, manufacturing and electrical engineering to design and test robots and its automated systems. In addition I also develop new programs and applications for robots to use.</description></education>
