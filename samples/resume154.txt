<description>During the last year I have been employed as a Job Shopper with ITT Defense Systems in Amityville, New York in the position of Senior Production Planner. My contract with this company has ended. I accepted this job knowing that it was temporary and with full knowledge that the job would not lead to a permanent position. In this position I worked on the Joint Strike Force program for the US Air Force and Lockheed Martin. My responsibilities were to plan, schedule and track products through all phases of manufacturing to assure on time deliveries using Deltek's ERP/MRP systems (Cost Point). 

In October 2010 I was laid off from Miteq. Inc. a telecommunications company located in Hauppauge, New York where I'd worked for seventeen years as a Senior Material/Production Planner on military and commercial applications. In this position I was responsible for all material procurement and all aspects of production in an engineering and manufacturing environment. My primary responsibilities included reviewing sales orders and planning and scheduling jobs through all phases of production to assure on time deliveries using Micro Soft's (Solomon) ERP/MRP systems

I am looking for a permanent position and welcome the opportunity to further discuss with you the possibility of any open position in the areas of material or production control. If you have any questions or would like to schedule an interview, please don't hesitate to contact me by telephone or by e-mail at jimteer@optonline.net  I have enclosed my resume below for you to review. I look forward to hearing from you.</description>
