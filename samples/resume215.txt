<experience end='present' start='722299'>Gained: <description>B/A hons degree in Information Illustration. I successfully qualified as a student studying a three year course using Adobe Illustrator-Photoshop CS3 and MS Office Suite. I used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to produce rendering on some of the illustrations I produced to give them a natural look of either metal or wood texture for their layout in the graphical artwork I produced for their presentation with the use of a wacom graphics tablet. I also used a digital camera for some of the images inserted in these graphical layouts. I applied research skills in writing essay's and discussions at seminars. During my 1st and 2nd years I trained using PowerPoint which involved research into my chosen subject and producing written and illustrative material placed into my designed layout for presentation to an audience and during my 2nd year worked on 3 months industrial training at Clayton Engineering in Blackpool being involved in drawing and updating illustrations for manual updates for ventilation systems produced here and converted their line work using Adobe Illustrator CS3. During my final year I wrote a dissertation called The Historical Development of Illustrative Art which involved tracing and writing about the development of art from the earliest recorded events in humane social history around the world in different cultures, religions and political environments</description>

<skills>Key Skills:

<skills>33 Years experience as a technical illustrator in various industries and taken a variety of computer RSA training courses during this period using either Mac or Desktop computers so I could easily adapt to either of these computer systems. I gained IT and MS Office Suite skills and qualifications including: Word Processing, Desktop Publishing, PowerPoint, Photoshop, Internet, IBT2, Excel and Access. And I also use with qualifications AutoCAD 2D-3D and Adobe Illustrator CS3 
Willingness to learn-Acquired new skills through previous employment and creative projects</skills></skills>
<experience>Problem Solving-<description>Involved in complex artwork creating assignments for the shipbuilding, automotive and aerospace industries working with Technical Authors
Experience producing illustrations for manual updates in the aerospace industry these were AMM-Aircraft Maintenance Manual, IPC-Illustrated Parts Catalogue and CMM-Component Maintenance Manual
Produced illustrative material to various company layouts, formats and specifications on manual updates
Attention to detail when involved in complex construction on large scale engineering projects
Used a variety of illustrative material before computers were introduced items like Ellipse Guides 15°-80°, Midas Elite 2000 Headliner Printer, Agfa 3100 Repromaster PMT Camera, Croy Typing Machine, Rotring Pens all types and sizes, Permatrace Film, Letraset and Pantone, Letratone Colour and Mechanical Tint, Proportional Dividers and Perspective Grids of all types including 35° Isometric Grids

Personal Profile:

M
y college training ended successfully in June 1978 with most of my career spent working on site either on staff or contract with experience organising and drawing illustrations updating manuals in the shipbuilding, automotive and aerospace industries with 3D and 2D illustrative artwork including systems diagrams, electrical circuit diagrams, schematic diagrams and draughtsman's drawings. Sometimes I provided illustrative material from sketches or proportions off the actual component itself when draughtsman's drawings weren't available. My aerospace work was on the civil and military side of aviation to specifications ATA100 and AVP70 covering the positioning and installation of component illustrated parts along with aircraft fittings. I was also involved in the production of graphic artwork and logos for leaflets and brochures for various sales promotions. Periods between full time employment working for companies on site I have worked as a freelance illustrator at home on my desktop computer with access to the Internet using Adobe Photoshop CS2, MS Office Suite which includes Word Processing, Desktop Publishing and PowerPoint and I also use AutoCAD 2006 LT 2D-3D all with the use of my scanner, wacom graphics tablet and printer. I also use a 35mm SLR camera and 28mm wide angle lens digital camera for the graphical layouts I produce and after the introduction of computers I had considerable work and training experience with qualifications on both Desktop and Mac computers so all my skills and work experience I have gained over my career I can now use more effectively using them</description></experience>
