<title>Senior Engineer/Architect</title>
<description>Direct teams of in-house and outside consultants in design and development of Linux based security solutions. Responsible for scoping projects while maintaining a budget of $500,000 annually. Development of white papers and testing procedures as well as lectures for prospective clients as well as trade shows. Reported to the President and presented weekly updates of various projects based on project plans and budget updates for investors.
Some of the major components of the solution were an identity management backbone constructed through a BI policy filter which made calls to a cipher broker based upon a HSM card for security. The appliance itself was tested to work in a multi operating system environment so I used my knowledge of Microsoft and *ix technologies to make it operate without the need to change client topologies.
Code was written in Java and C with drivers being developed for the Suse Linux Enterprise Server 64 version.</description></job>

<title>Senior Architect / Technical Project &amp; Team Leader</title>
<description>Direct teams of in-house and outside consultants in large-scale projects to implement a broad range of Novell software solutions in client companies. Involved in development of the core architecture to optimize performance of the Novell business solutions. Liaison with clients; provide on-site technical training to client staff. Write custom solutions in multiple programming languages to extend the software capability for clients. Selected projects include: 
Dell: Architected and Integrated a Linux server configuration management system for ease of deployment for various distributions of Linux, Unix and Microsoft servers in there center. Developed custom pre and post install shell scripts to perform various tasks at the appropriate time.
DoD (Sandia): Installed two different configuration management systems. The first system was allowed to use dhcp so I integrated with the pxe boot for loading various server images at boot time other additions/subtractions were done by a scheduled cron job deploying to the server. The second was a static ip based configuration management system, because of security, in this sub infrastructure I was able to push configurations based on xml data which held the configuration data for the specific servers to be configured.
Oracle Install Scripts: Developed a set of scripts that wrapped around the oracle silent install and read a config file that was produced by question response offered to the user when installing oracle on the server.  
The Gap: Led a cross functional team consisting of customer, IBM and Novell personal in a POS deployment architecture. Integrated existing directory solution and new IRES 2.0 technology from IBM along with POS software in order to develop, integrate and launch a successful new POS system for the Gap at a global level.  Wrote custom perl and shell scripts to configure thin client machines from the Linux deployment server.
UrbanOutfitters: Led a team of technical staff to deploy a new POS solution. Brought into the project with three weeks until rollout. Due to technical issues once I was onsite I evaluated the executive required timelines and reviewed the issues technical staff was having with the POS rollout. Being able to understand both the business requirements from the executives and well as the technical issues was able to restructure the project to exceed the rollout by three days finishing the project on time and under budget.
AAFES: Oversaw a team from IBM to develop and integrate a new POS system for all PX?s worldwide. Though the project was able to direct to staffing the required skill sets needed by the project and time frame of each task due to the ability to understand and bring together the business requirements and the complex infrastructure already in place. Since placing the right technical skill at the right time on site was able to shorten development and deployment.  
Daimler Chrysler: Formed and led a cross-functional team in developing a $4 million CRM/sales solution that included an identity management solution, back-end database, and web interface. Enabled a 50% reduction in on-hand inventory at dealer locations; ease of access to customer data allowed for more targeted marketing initiatives.</description></job>
