<description>A data processing system generates recommendations for on-line shopping by scoring
recommendations matching the customer's cart contents product page, configuration page, email and/
or history using predetermined scoring criteria, such as item availability, item price, relevance of the item
to the customer, item clarity, item exposure, total purchase amount in the cart, margin, recommendation
confidence and lift, shopper profile matches, seasonality, customer history, time dependency, product
marketing emphasis, substitutability, item popularity and/or product attributes associated with the
recommended item. The scored recommendations may be ranked and/or filtered to prioritize the
recommendations so that the best recommendation is selected for presentation to the customer. In
addition, one or more scoring criteria or product attributes for the recommended item may be used to
select a specific selling point/message text for inclusion with the selected recommendation.

<description>A recommendation appliance, system and method are provided for generating and deploying additional
web page content or functionality (e.g., retail recommendations) to an existing web page server system.
For example, the present invention may be embodied as a reverse proxy server that is inserted as
an intermediate network node between a web server and the end users accessing the web server. In
this position, the recommendation appliance can introduce recommendation messages to web pages
generated by the web server without requiring any modification to the code or architecture of the web
server. In addition, the appliance may separately track the transaction activities of end users who
receive recommendation messages and the transaction activities of end users who do not receive
recommendation messages, so that a comparison of the effectiveness of the recommendations may
efficiently be demonstrated without requiring any modification to the code or architecture of the web
server.</description></job>
