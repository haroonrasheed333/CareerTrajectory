Project Title: <description>Synthesis and characterization of Polyethylene glycol based growth factor releasing hydrogels guiding neural stem cell fate.

Designed and synthesized new cross linkers for our existing hydrolytically degradable hydrogel system. 
Obtained a tunable degradation rate of PEG by altering the hydrophobicity environment of the ester (different length of CH2).
Cultured PC12 cells and split it on top of a coverslip as well as encapsulated the cells inside hydrogels.
Utilized antibody and fluorescence microscopy to study the role of integrin in 2D compared with 3D cultures.
Designed affinity crosslinkers for hepatocyte growth factor present HGF in a novel way other than in soluble form or covalently immobilized form.
Quantified the release of HGF from the affinity hydrogel using ELISA and characterized the mechanical properties.
( Rheology experiments) and swelling properties.</description></job>
