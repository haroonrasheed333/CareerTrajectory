Projects Undertaken

November 2011 ­ Present ­ Jwaneng Cut 8 Depressurization Project

This project entails drilling of six deep dewatering boreholes targeting fractures/faults at
450m-500m. The end product of the project is ensuring that, if water is encountered at depth,
it should be removed, hence maintaining the initial slope design conditions, which were
designed with the assumption that the pit is dry.

Local geology include Kalahari sands, calcrete, shales, carbonaceous shales, quartzitic
shales/quartzites, dolomites and the dolerite dykes and sills.

September 2011 ­ Discovery Limited Dewatering Project (Toteng-Maun)

Discovery Dewatering project was aimed at dewatering fractures/faults at the proposed zeta
pit area. Local geology includes Shales, slates, siltstones and quartzites</description></job>
