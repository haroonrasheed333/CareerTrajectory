<summary>OBJECTIVE:

<objective>Ideally, to make gobs of money for doing as little as possible, preferably with a really fancy title, such as Senior Vice President of Something Or Other.  As that continues to elude me, I am willing to continue working harder than others for mortal wages.</objective>  
SUMMARY:
<summary>Persuasive, competitive, accomplished project manager with international experience.  I do everything as if I had to sign my name to it and have had more careers than most people will have jobs in their lives.  Highly intelligent, I can be taught anything and will eventually become the &quot;go-to guy.&quot;  Excellent written and verbal communications and interpersonal skills combined with military discipline, world-class customer service, extensive computer knowledge and a background in telecommunications engineering enable me to quickly analyze situations, determine the correct course of action and lead teams to the desired outcome.</summary></summary>
