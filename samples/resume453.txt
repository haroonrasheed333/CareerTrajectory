          <description>Aided in the structural testing of the HPH rotor blades by working with team members to determine how and where the rotor blades were to be loaded and
          anchored wherein attention to detail was critical given the rotor blades' material composition (balsa wood, Styrofoam, and other light-weight materials)
          Used different types of carbon fiber sheets and epoxy to assemble connection pieces that essentially acted as nodes for all of the carbon fiber tubes and
          structural trusses that made up the structure of the HPH
          Safely cut carbon fiber tubes to exacting specifications with a wet saw which would go on to comprise the structure of the HPH</description></job>

<description>Product Redesign of DeWalt DW304 Reciprocating Saw                                                                                                             1/12-5/12
          Tested reciprocating saws of three different brand names (DeWalt, Ridgid, and Milwaukee) in terms of different characteristics such as power and speed of
          cut, line of cut visibility, vibrations, balance, weight, ergonomics and comfort, and noise
          Applied different measurement techniques for recording performance and ergonomic data
          Collaborated with team members to create a 120 page benchmarking report wherein a statistical analysis of the resulting parametric and nonparametric data
          from testing (using ANOVA and the Tukey Test for the parametric data, and Kruskalwallis and the Bonferroni Test for the nonparametric data) was
          performed to determine statistical differences in characteristics amongst the saws
          Conceived and modeled (using Pro/ENGINEER) different redesigns of the DeWalt DW304 reciprocating saw's shoe and associated parts aimed at
          enhancing the line of cut visibility of the saw with respect to the user's POV corresponding to the most common user cutting positions as described from
          users' on the job accounts and research
          Prototyped a redesign concept utilizing milling machines and metal lathes in addition to other metal machining tools</description></job>
