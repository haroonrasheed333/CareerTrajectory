Currently the Lead Special Education teacher for the high school, I've implemented IEP's for both resource and mainstreamed students; making sure the teachers receive the modifications; communicating with administrators and the high school counselor, and being a part of the ARD MEETINGS. In addition to these duties, I teach all subjects in the resource classroom. Modifying high school subjects, assignments and grades, I have also assessed students IEP progress reports.
