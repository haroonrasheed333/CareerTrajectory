<title>IT Specialist</title> (GS-13 step 8)
<description>Developed National Databases for : 
(ADP PLAN/PLANMAN)
With this project, each VA facility in the U.S. was required to access our centrally located system and enter their projected costs for all  IT equipment/services for a six year period.
Upon completion of data entry, it was my duty to compile all the data and program reports to the administration in Washigton, D.C.
The final data had to be collected and shipped to D.C. This was accomplished via MagTape reel to reel. Which of course, took a few days of constant monitoring.

 (D&amp;PPM).Drug and Pharmeacutical Project Management
This program (written in FOXPRO), collected all drug dispensing information from each VA facility. The data was then transferred to a central location for compilation of data, then forwarded to the Hines VA medical center. This data was used for tracking Prescription Drug Dispensing Information.</description></job>












<job id='2'><title>Senior Maintenance Developer</title>
<description>Duties for this position included diagnosis and correction of pre-existing defects in the software and re-writing the programs as deemed necessary. Changes to documentation were also part of the responsibility.
 
Drug Accountability V3.0
Personnaly corrected xx number of defects out of xxx.
This package provides functionality to maintain a perpetual inventory of drugs. Interfacing with the Generic Inventory Package (GIP) and the prime vendors. Invoice data increments drug balances in pharmacy locations and master vaults. Pharmacy's dispensing software packages pass dispensing data to Drug Acountability which decrements the drug balances in pharmacy locations.

Controlled Substances V3.0
The Controlled Substances (CS) software package is one segment of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) installed at VA medical centers. The Controlled Substances module provides functionality to monitor and track the receipt, inventory, and dispensing of all controlled substances. This module provides the pharmacy with the capability to define a controlled substance location and a list of controlled substances to maintain a perpetual inventory.

This software provides the capability for pharmacy personnel to receive a Controlled Substances order, automatically update the quantity on hand, and view a receipt history. Nursing personnel are provided with the ability to request orders for Controlled Substances via on-demand requests. Pharmacy may dispense controlled substances via the software automating all necessary documents (VA FORMS 10-2321 and 10-2638) to complete an order request. The software provides functionality to record AMIS and Cost data, address returns to stock, destructions, order cancellations, transfers between locations, and log outpatient prescriptions.

Pharmacy Prescription Practice V1.0
I received quarterly updates via diskette that contained all information related to Veterans' visits to each VA Medical Center. Through my software, a physician could determine when/if the patient had been to other facilities. This reduced the chances over over medication or substance abuse. This package was retired in March of 2009.

Self taught following languages for duties other than M programming:
Interactive Reader Language (IRL) - Controlled Substances
For programming hand held barcode readers for reading patient wrist bands.

Procomm 2.01  - Drug Accountability
FOXPRO - D&amp;PPM
DELPHI 4,5 &amp; 6 - Drug Accountability (replaced Procomm)
Java - Pharmacy Reengineering (PRE)
KEA - Terminal emulation software for creating macros to perform M functions quicker and more efficiently
RPC Broker Interface with Delphi and Drug Accountability
