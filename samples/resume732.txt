<summary>DEAR HIRING MANAGER:

<objective>Viewing the job posting on your website, I feel I can be a vital employee to your clients, your projects, and as a colleague. Pursuing
two degrees in Economics, and Political Science with concentrations in accounting and finance exemplifies my determination and
drive that would be an asset to your company and your long term goals. During my time at the university, I have honed my time
management skills, academic and analytical research capabilities, organizational capacity to allow me to participate in many orga-
nizations regarding finance and economics, as well as keeping my university coursework in check. I am also in the midst of prepar-
ing myself for the CFA Level 1 exam, and the CPA exam which I plan to complete in 2013. As a recent graduate with relevant course
experience, I am seeking a position pertinent to my education, passion, and natural abilities. I am driven and eager to launch my
career in a field where I can join a team to serve the interest of the public and greater community.</objective>

<summary>My passion and drive for the finance and accounting fields came to life when I worked as an executive assistant for the Gilbert
Quinones Law Firm, where I was soon promoted to the Staff Accountant position. As an intern my duties involved assistance to
all counselors prepare general ledgers of accounts payable, accounts receivable and prepare timely bank reconciliations. As my
administrative assistant tasks I was able to increase office efficiency and productivity my introducing new forms of accounting
software as well as filing systems that allowed the office to work in a more harmonious environment. As the staff accountant I was
in charge of assisting many projects that included a cross-department collaboration; wherein I assisted in business plans expand-
ing the firm by managing relations between the IT, Finance, Research and Development departments in this multi-disciplinary
project I was exposed project management and business strategies and communication skills. My time at the firm was extremely
rewarding when the firm adopted my ac- counting, and filing systems I knew that my thought and input meant something to
the company. I was proud of the part of the projects I was involved with and I know that my contributions for the company were
meaningful, a feeling that I would love to experience again.

During my time at PM Entertainment LLC, I was exposed to the entertainment industry and the operations of hierarchal firms. I
was in charge of budgeting analysis and forecasting expenditures for PM Productions, Distribution, and Parallel Media, all subsid-
iary companies. I learned negotiation procedures for the Directors Guild of America as well as a wide variety of vendors in dealing
with pre, and post productions of a film. I learned how to manage multiple firms' finances by generating weekly and monthly
reports presented to my supervisors, financiers, and investors. I gained the knowledge of strenuous multi-tasking firms' decisions
and business plans, as well as being immaculate with every report and interpretation I generated. Not only was I exposed to the
finance and accounting side of this industry, but I was also in charge of paralegal assistance to the attorneys on hand. I lead many
projects dealing with the financial discovery of employee and plaintiff/defendant audits to be used as viable pieces of evidence
within cases. My time spent at this firm was an invaluable experience that will help me on my future endeavors in the financial and
legal aspects of my career.

The combination of my clientele experience, along with my accounting, and financial analysis, and legal experience has strength-
ened my enthusiasm for a career in a field where all can be utilized to my optimal utility. I have also discovered that I excel at
working independently, under stress, and collaboratively with members from different disciplines. I am eager to take what I have
learned and apply both my academic and professional knowledge to where results can make a real change.

I believe that with my strong work ethic and professional skills in a nurturing and competitive environment, I can make immediate
and lasting contributions. If you are looking for a motivated and dedicated team player, please contact me at (310) 913-9011 or at
alexanderdeluna@gmail.com.

Sincerely yours,


Alexander De Luna</summary></summary>
