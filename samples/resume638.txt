<description>Thesis Title: Simulation and modeling of propagation of nerve impulse and its blockage by external electrical stimulation. 
Objective: To analyze ways to block nerve impulse propagation, which could aid in incapacitation, or stimulate functional neuromuscular activity for muscular therapy, or possibly act as a localized, electrical pain reliever.

Performed model representation and numerical simulation of an axon with multiple segments to explain many important features of propagation of nerve impulse, such as voltage gating of ion channels and the generation of action potentials.
Extracted useful parameters such as the action potential velocity as a function of diameter, and made suitable comparisons with reports in the literature for model validation.
Analyzed and successfully demonstrated the possibilities for blocking action potential propagation through external electrical means such as DC and AC excitation.
Obtained current and frequency thresholds for the blocking stimulation on an unmyelinated nerve fiber.
All of the research work was performed using Matlab 7.1, Cadence, and Orcad.
Suggested potential studies and modeling efforts relevant to the nerve impulse conduction and its blockage like triggering of electroporation under high field conditions.</description></job></experience>

<professional>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 

<description>Assisted Mano Vikas Mandir, Ajmer with activities like teaching the disabled children and promoting inclusive education - (Aug 2009 - Nov 2009)
Individually researched on the following topics as part of the masters' curriculum - 
Relationship between membrane excitability and single ion channel open-close kinetics - The objective was to understand the stochastic behavior of channels and then incorporate this aspect for external voltage pulses of various shapes and for &quot;N&quot; number of nodes. To simulate the kinetics of open-close process, a random number generator and the probability distribution functions of open- and closed- channel lifetimes was used. Initial conditions of each particle are obtained from the model. A series of iterations was performed wherein each particle state is examined. MATLAB was used to perform these experiments.
Electrotherapy for wound healing - The objective was to discuss various modalities of electrotherapy, which are currently being used and determine how each of them works towards wound healing.
Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems -- The objective was to understand MEMS fabrication processes and two traditional methods for forming MEMS devices, bulk and surface micromachining. 
Moore's law: The origin and economic implications - The objective was to describe the origin, nature, and implications of &quot;Moore's Law&quot;. It begins with a historical overview of the major developments in semiconductor industry that led up to Gordon Moore's</description> <publications>1965 observation and then discusses about the implications and finally the future of Moore's law. 
Applications of Pulsed Power in Bioelectrics -- The objective was to discuss ways to produce nanosecond duration pulsed electric fields that will in turn; allow the examination of the effects of ultra short duration, high intensity electric fields on living cells. Pulsed power technology is also the enabling technology for Bioelectrics. 
Mechatronic Domain Modeling with Bond Graphs - Bond graph modeling technology finds application in analysis of dynamic systems in different domains. By writing the source equations and then applying the bond graph modeling rules, any kind of system can be developed using bond graphs. The final product is a comprehensive graphical representation of model whose parameters can be varied according to the system in question. By understanding the behavior of electrical and mechanical systems using tools like 20-Sim, more complex electro-mechanical systems were modeled. 
Presented a paper on &quot;Simulation of Direct Field Oriented High Speed Induction Motor&quot; at IT-BHU, India certified by IEE (2004) 
Presented a paper on &quot;Seraphim motors - A renewed technology for high speed transportation&quot; at NIT Hamirpur (HP), India  (2004)</publications>
<description>Achieved 97% in behavioral abilities in all India IT aptitude test conducted by NIIT, India (2003)
Received the prestigious Gargi award by the state board for exemplary performance in High School (1999)</description></professional>
