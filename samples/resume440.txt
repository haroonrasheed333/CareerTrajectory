The role of antiviral agents including monoclonal antibodies targeting CCR5 will also be assessed in order to determine its efficacy to block the HIV fusion process.</description></job>

<summary>SCIENTIFIC SKILLS
<summary>My lab skills constitute extensive experience in the field of molecular biology, cell biology, virology and tissue culture techniques. I have vast experience of working with infectious samples and meticulous logging in the identity and associated data of patients.
During doctoral and postdoctoral period I got hands on experience of various techniques as listed below

Virology
*	I have an extensive experience of working in BL-2 lab handling infectious viruses like HCV, HGV and HIV. 
*	Viral preparation and titration assay by using antiviral agents
*	Isolation of viral RNA from clinical samples
Transduction of viruses into various cell lines (primary cells and other cell lines) to evaluate their functional efficacy and isolation of effector T cells.
Isolation of novel TCRs from hybridomas and cloning into retroviral vector.

Molecular Biology 
I am skilled in various molecular biology techniques as following
*	Extraction of RNA and DNA from clinical samples and cell lines.
Independently designing primers for amplifying viral genes/ any other gene, amplifying (using RT-PCR and PCR), analyzing the products by electrophoresis and interpreting results. Designing primers for site directed mutagenesis and constructing mutant clones of wild type.
Planing and performing gene expression reporter assays.
Designing cloning strategies, doing successful transformation, colony PCR, preparing mini, midi, maxi and mega preps.
Western blotting and executing its results.
*	Analyzing sequencing data, using software to align them, detect mutations and phyolgenetic tree construction
*	ELISA to detect viral replication and also ELISA for other biochemical assays.

Immunology
*	Selection and expansion of intrahepatic T cells from biopsy samples
*	ELISPOT assays for analyzing cytotoxic T cell activity
*	Flow cytometry. Analyzing and interpreting data by using FlowJo.

Cell Biology
*	I am confident in handling number of cell lines, primary cell cultures, maintaining them for assays, freezing and proper storage and keeping track record of them.
*	I can independently perform the transfections in different cells.</summary></summary>
