<resume canonversion='2' dateversion='2' present='734594' xml:space='preserve'><summary><objective>Dear sir or madam,

Please consider me for any position for which I am qualified.</objective> 
<summary>I have an accredited associates' degree in biomedical electronics and I came, very, close to an engineering degree in the seventies. I wrote PID, DDC software in BASIC for municipal waste water treatment. While I was in hospital management classes, I taught AutoCAD, built panels at GE-IS&amp;E and I did cad design work at Rust Engineering on a paper mill. 
I am and I have been a computer scientist for, many years. I have worked on, almost, everything in my life.

Thank you in advance.</summary></summary>
