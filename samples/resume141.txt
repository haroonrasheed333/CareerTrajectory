			<summary>Operations Analyst/Administrator/Developer
QUALIFICATIONS 
More than 20 years of experience in print and data center environments. I began working with</summary>
<experience><description>printing of output, distribution, and quality control.  I have worked console operations, and for a time was the Night Supervisor of Operations.  In 1997, I became the Operations Support Analyst.  This started with the supervision of the forms inventory, management of all hardware and environmental controls in the print and data center facilities, and finding effective means to streamlining processes within computer operations.  I eventually took on the reporting and analysis of all operations activities as well as the administration of the Operations Management database, a problem tracking and reporting system.  This involves creation of adhoc queries, monthly reporting, updating the MIS intra-net webpage, and incident tracking and resolution. I have worked with a variety of software applications.  These include Microsoft Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Crystal Reporting, Peregrine Service Center, and Macromedia Dreamweaver.  Familiar with UNIX, HP3000, and AS400 platforms.  

ROLES and RESPONSIBILITIES
More recently my responsibilities have progressed to provide more software administrative and development support, as well as providing support for other applications as needed.  This includes help in supporting COLD,  CDE,  Vertices media management systems, and CA Servicedesk.  I provide development and support of Solimar SPDE and Business Objects.  I have provided training to many colleagues, created strong working relationships, and have consistently produced exceptional results</description>
