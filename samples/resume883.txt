Dear Sir/Ma'am
Please accept this letter as an application for the position of Customer Service Representative currently available with your company, as listed on SnagaJob.com. My resume is attached for your review and consideration, and I believe you will find me well qualified.
Detailed on my resume you will find a solid background in Sales and Customer Service, with the last ten years working in an inbound call center. During my years as an Intake Specialist I have become adept at learning the policy related guidelines, protocols and proprietary software that our clients ask us to be proficient at, in order to process insurance claims for their insured and claimants.
My years working in sales and customer service have provided me with a heightened sensitivity towards the needs of customers, especially those who are going through a crisis, such as loss of life or severe illness. Exposure to these situations on a regular basis allows me to be naturally empathetic towards people and their struggles.
I believe your company would provide an atmosphere to which I would be well suited, as well as one where my experience would be valuable.
Please contact me at your earliest convenience so that I may share with you my background and enthusiasm for the job. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Richard Johnson</summary></summary>
