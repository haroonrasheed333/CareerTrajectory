 Job Responsibilities: 
 <description>Phases of vehicle worked on and experience as lead mechanic
 Engines: Cat, Cummins, Detroit, Mack, Deutz, Yanmar, Kubota, 
Isuzu, John Deere, Hatz, Fary-Mann, Fiat-Allis, Mitsubishi, Hino, Ford 7.3, 6.0 Powerstroke.   Both electronically and mechanically controlled fuel/air systems. 
In gas: Chevrolet, Ford, Cadillac, Honda, Briggs and Stratton.
 Problems: There was always low power and or smoking problems, oil/coolant leaks, noisy engines, hard and no starting with hot/cold engines. There were very, few catastrophic failures. Many problems were from previous mechanics that didn't have info or know how to properly repair. 
Transmissions: Mack, Fuller/Eaton, various five and six speeds. 
 Problems: hard shifting, no shifting, grinding, no going into either hi/lo range, noise and vibrations in them and in drive line. This also includes PTO, air shift and cable shift.
A/C: Not cooling at all or at idle, going up the road, cools for a while then quits, starts back.
Brakes: Including anti-lock brakes. ABS light on, brakes locking up when hot, hanging, won't release from parking or after application. Smoking, not a good pedal, lock down after a few applications w/ pedal, trailer brakes won't release or same scenario with trailer brakes as with tractor. 
Air Systems: not building air, slow, build, compressor comes back on shortly after governor purges dryer. Air leaks, pumping oil in dryer. Suspensions dump valves on trucks and trailers.
Electrical systems: Some trucks had a switch for trouble codes. Most of the time I had to go by complaints from driver on engine problems. 
Starting/Charging problems, lighting, and installation of safety and beacon lights on trucks. Interior problems, trailer plugs, all of gauges and driver comforts. Lighting problems with the heavy haul trailers and getting them to burn bright. Much of problem solving on electrical w/ construction equipment.
Suspensions: Tire wear problems, steering hard one way or another, no turning as good one way as the other, wandering on the road, tandems not tracking right, vibration in front wheels.
 Hydraulic systems. Something always had a flow or pressure problem. Working on the construction equipment, often trouble with pilot pressure systems, electric over hydraulics, busted hoses. 
 Trailers used hydraulics to support goose neck when disconnected and holding it up off road.  
 Dump trucks were fairly reliable, not much trouble. A pump every now and then, but only if operator ran for a long period of time.</description></job>
