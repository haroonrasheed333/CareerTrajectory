Software modules were initiated with a corporate sponsor identifying system requirements and market need. From there I lead requirements gathering and presentation of the results included cost benefits and anticipated sales to support the ROI.  Once approved the design phase kicked off.  I project managed developers who designed the code.  The key here was scope creep, budgeting enforcement and keeping to a schedule. Testing was overseen and once I signed off on the test along with my senior management, piloting began with a trusted customer. Managing the change control and expectations was the next responsibility and once approved the module was implemented, monitored, then released to sales to marketing to announce and implement.
Projects were managed in general accordance with SDLC framework.</description></job>
