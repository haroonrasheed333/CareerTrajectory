<experience>Role:
        <description>Pre-Acquisition: Conducted sales and marketing due diligence in China. Identified sales projections as being
        artificially high due to significant &quot;channel-stuffing.&quot; Developed the business unit synergy case.
        Post-Acquisition: Participated in product and technology evaluations and developed the global product and
        technology transfer roadmaps, jettisoning overlapping development work between US, Italy, India and China.
Partners: n/a. Emerson-led acquisition.
Result: Company acquired for $750 million in cash, it was the largest M&amp;A deal between a private Chinese company
and a foreign investor at the time.

                                Post Acquisition Integrations &amp; Restructuring
Target: Emerson Network Power (Inter-Company)
Activity: Restructuring
Background: During the market-wide &quot;dot com&quot; melt down in 2001, Emerson Network Power went from a $1.2B/year
run rate to a ~$600M run rate, virtually overnight. We couldn't contract fast enough and I was asked to direct the
restructuring of Emerson Network Power's North American operations. Past technology and product transfers were
marred by quality problems and missed ship dates, due to poor product documentation, &quot;tribal knowledge&quot;.
Role: I directed product transfers, leading over 100 cross functional team members in transferring production of $75M
of goods (30 product lines, 3 supporting processes and 21,000+ part numbers) from 4 US plants to 2 Mexican facilities...
in 11 months. Assembling cross-functional teams of key players from the 6 plants, we developed a standardized
product transfer process with defined roles and responsibilities and established controls to eliminate work-arounds. The
process of documenting everything prior to the transfer shined a light on serious gaps in how we controlled
documentation and information flows between engineering, procurement, operations and quality. With the support of
Emerson Network Power's Senior VP of Operations, Engineering and others, we simultaneously standardized
engineering, operations, procurement and quality processes across North American operations at the same time.
Result: Product quality actually was maintained and we had no delays in committed ship dates. We generated $5.1M
in annual OP with $2.5 charge to OIOD. The product transfer process was heralded as an Emerson &quot;Best Practice&quot; and
training was provided to other divisions.


Target: Integrated Emerson Energy Systems into Emerson Network Power (Intra-Company)
Activity: Plant Transfer and Business System Integration
Background: Following the acquisition of Ericsson's Energy Systems (EES), a DC power provider, Emerson needed to
eliminate operating overhead by closing their facility in Monterrey, Mexico facility and consolidating operations into a
shared Emerson Network Power facility in Reynosa Mexico. At the same time, back office order fulfillment activities
performed in Dallas needed to transition from the company's old MRP system into Emerson's MRP system.
Role: Trained EES and ENP personnel in product transfer and supervised process. Utilized Value-Stream Mapping to
re-engineer the product configuration, quote and ordering process.
Result: Successfully transitioned products and reduced configuration-quote-order cycle time.
                                            Private Equity Transactions
Co-founded Key Bridge Partners, a private equity firm targeting electronics, equipment manufacturers and service
companies with revenues between $15-$100M. Responsible for prospecting, business valuations, securing equity
financing and due diligence. Developed robust funnel to identify and evaluate investment opportunities sourced through
investment bankers, industry contacts, sell-side advisors, conferences and industry associations. Selected transactions
listed below.

Target: Industrial Engineered Blowers for Power Generation &amp; Mining Operations. $50M sales; $2.9M EBITDA.

         Segments

Target: Rubber &amp; Plastic Processing Equipment, $62M sales; $3.2M EBITDA.
Deal Type: Acquisition and recapitalization.

components. China posed for double-digit growth in rubber segment.
